Three instructional strategies useful for changing student conceptions include (1) eliciting naÃÂÃÂ¯ve conceptions from students, (2) challenging nonscientific conceptions, and (3) emphasizing conceptual frameworks throughout instruction.

2. Facilitate rejection of non-scientific ideas about natural selection; and
3. Engage students in an activity they perceive to be interesting and valuable.""",,"The instructor began the discussion of human evolution
by asking students: ""Are contemporary populations of
humans evolving? Please explain how you know."" Students
wrote their responses to this question, hereafter called the
""Human Evolution Question,"" on index cards. Written
responses are important because writing forces students to
clarify their thoughts, and the index cards can be collected
to provide the instructor with a glimpse of how students in
the course are thinking about the question. After students
finished writing their individual responses, the instructor
asked them to discuss their answers in small groups in order
to determine whether they could come to a group
consensus. These peer discussions provide students with
an opportunity to verbalize, clarify, and defend their ideas,
and allow them to ""try out"" their ideas on peers before they
present them to a larger audience. Small group discussions
may lead to greater learning than classroom-wide discus-
sions because students are more likely to participate when
other students, instead of instructors, lead discussions
(Philips and Powers 1979).
The instructor then solicited verbal answers from a wide
range of students. He used a class list to randomly call on
students and recorded their answers on a PowerPoint slide.

Next, the instructor proposed to work through the list of
student ideas and began by pointing out that there was a wide
diversity of answers and that some of them contradicted each
other. He asked students to apply the three requirements of
natural selection to assess each idea. For example, students
frequently propose that humans are evolving to have less hair
(becoming more bald). The instructor would then ask the
student to consider each requirement (i.e., Is there variation in
baldness?
After the discussion of studentsâÃÃ´ ideasâÃÃ®most of which
relate to traits that are probably not evolvingâÃÃ®the instructor
discussed two traits that likely are favored by natural
selection: HIV resistance and height. 
At the end of the discussion of HIV resistance and
human height, the instructor asked students to review and
critique their original answers to the Human Evolution
Question. On the same index card, he asked students to
""Re-read your answer to the question (Are contemporary
populations of humans evolving?) and evaluate your
reasoning.
To encourage them to
think critically about their initial ideas (Hewson et al.
1998), the instructor provided students with five sample
student answers and asked them to critique the answers in
groups before he asked them to critique their own answers.
Each group discussed one sample answer and then the class
discussed what was correct and incorrect about each
answer",,Formative assessment; Exam; Summative Assessment,,"Formative assessment: ""Formative assessment will be invaluable for incorporating a discussion of human evolution into an introductory biology course...This is why we have all students write down an answer and why we randomly call on numerous students.

After students work in teams to discuss an assigned scenario, they come together as a class so that each team is prepared to explain and defend 
a unique scenario (i.e., a team-based ""jigsaw"" design).

long-term data set from a published manuscript.
âÃÂ¢ identify different sources of variation within a data set and the 
consequences of grouping biological units into larger entities for the 
interpretation of results.
âÃÂ¢ apply 
transect-based vegetation sampling 
to estimate plant 
community composition, richness, and diversity in two different 
prairie restoration parcels with different burn regimes.

material prior to each lab to prepare for the planned activity. 
We also assign a post-lab writing assignment after each of the 
first three labs.
Activities in class: In the first week, we introduce students 
to the prairie module by critically reading and evaluating a 
published paper that motivates the study that students will 
conduct in subsequent weeks. We provide students with a set of 
research questions about how tallgrass prairie plant communities 
are shaped by the season of burning and ask them to work in 
small groups to generate hypotheses for these questions. Students 
graph relevant data from the Towne and Kemp (2003) paper (see 
Tables 1 and 2 of the published research article) and interpret the 
graphs in light of their hypotheses. In the second week, students 
visit a tallgrass prairie and conduct transect-based vegetation 
sampling to quantify plant species composition and diversity 
in two different prairie restoration parcels subjected to different 
burning regimes. Here, students collect the same type of data 
that they evaluated in the Towne and Kemp (2003) paper to 
address the questions and hypotheses that they generated in 
Week 1. During the third week, students graph their data and 
conduct simple statistical tests to evaluate the hypotheses they 
developed during the first week of the module. In the fourth 
week, we challenge students to develop strategies for prairie 
management that integrate their understanding of prairie plant 
community dynamics with ""real-world"" constraints outlined in 
one of five randomly-assigned management scenarios.""",,Formative assessment; Presentation; Quiz; Worksheet; Summative Assessment; Other,post-lab writing assignment,"""This four-week lab module makes use of formative assessments

the instructor would review the pre-class quiz to determine whether or not additional class time would be needed to teach students how to interpret the alternative splicing schematics or to review content from a prior class about how transcription factors work. Clicker questions served a formative role for both 
the instructor and the students; they were designed to facilitate further inspection of the data or to redirect attention to the Big Question.

These density-dependent constraints on population growth can be described by the logistic growth equation. The logistic growth equation provides a clear extension of the density-independent process described by exponential growth.

""Possible modifications
We appreciate that many instructors may wish to imple-
ment the mCURE design but may not have access to some 
of the more expensive equipment used in our protocol. 
Here are a few modifications to circumvent some of these 
restrictions. Instructors can replace flow cytometry with 
direct microscopic counts, e.g., as in some of the earlier it-
erations of the HTC protocol (12). For those without access 
to either a flow cytometer or a fluorescence microscope, the 
protocol can still be completed using traditional agar-plate-
based methods. Our media can be prepared with agar (22) or 
replaced with a classic marine medium like Difco 2216 (BD). 
Although solid media generally select for different taxa than 
liquid media, for the purposes of a basic biology laboratory, 
this may not matter. After streaking a seawater sample on 
plates, individual colonies can be picked, grown up in liquid 
culture to increase cellular mass, or directly processed 
through DNA extraction. Colony PCR (26) may also be 
an attractive alternative identification method, particularly 
because this also eliminates the time and cost associated with 
DNA extraction. These last two steps may also help adapt 
the overall protocol for shorter time frames, e.g., academic 
quarters instead of semesters. Please note that our protocol 
uses low-nutrient and low-carbon media that typically select 
for non-pathogenic, oligotrophic marine bacterioplankton 
(14). The use of rich media and plate-based methods may 
increase the risk of cultivating pathogenic organisms. Finally, 
for those interested in freshwater environments, the same 
protocol can be conducted with freshwater media, either 
artificial (18, 27) or natural (28).""",,No,,Yes,,"""By the end of the semester, students should be able to:

assessments, as well as some summative assessments.
Self-Assessment
Self-Assessment is a major component of learning how to 
effectively keep a lab notebook and participate in laboratory 
work. There 
are 
specific  self-assessment 
assignments 
(Supporting Files S37-S39) that are sequenced throughout 
these labs to assess student learning at different stages and 
allow for reflection and self-correction. These are handed in at 
week 3 and week 7 to provide instructor feedback and make 
sure that students are not putting off this important exercise.
Lab Notebook 
Students are required to record exactly what they did, their 
materials and methods, their thinking and logic, questions 
and observations. This serves as a document of their research 
process, as well as  their thinking and 
learning process, 
which can be used for retrospective reflection and self-
correction. This aspect of the lab notebook works in tandem 
with the self-assessment course component. This model turns 
evaluation over to the students by having them complete the 
self-assessments. If the instructor does the evaluation, they undercut and devalue the studentâÃÃ´s work and autonomy and 
miss this opportunity for supporting students in building self-
regulation and metacognitive skills. An additional way to help 
students self-assess the lab notebook quality is to allow them 
to use their lab notebook as they complete the Lab Final. The 
grade on the Lab Final then also functions as a grade on the 
quality of the lab notebook.
Poster
Each lab pair is graded on the preparation and presentation 
of one poster. It is also important to give the students a chance 
to present the poster publicly, as it adds a level of authenticity 
and gives them that experience of presenting at a simulated 
professional poster session. The more exposure the students 
get to the larger campus audience during this presentation 
the better. Students who have their posters displayed in the 
science building report feelings of pride.
Lab Final
The lab final was developed as an objective direct assessment 
of skill and knowledge acquisition resulting from their research 
project. It tests students on both laboratory procedures and 
molecular techniques and research topic knowledge. For the 
lab final and instructor key email the primary author, Gita 
Bangera.
Survey
We used a retrospective survey, modeled on the CURE 
survey (21), to assess self-reported student learning outcomes. 
The survey is administered online at the end of the course, 
consists of 18 questions and takes approximately 20 minutes 
to complete. This survey asks students to reflect on: (1) their 
highest degree intentions and intended major prior to and after 
this course, (2) on their level of experience in targeted skill 
areas prior to taking this course and after taking this course, 
(3) the perceived benefits of this course in multiple technical, 
affective and cognitive domains and (4) their qualitative 
reflections regarding specific course components: lab work, 
lab notebooks, self-assessment and journal club. In these 
open-ended prompts, students were also asked the following:
1. Please describe how useful these specific components 
[journal club, lab work, self-assessment] were for you 
as a learning activity. How did it help you learn?

Tips on How to Use This Issue Focus on some aspect of this Issue (inter-decadal changes) and select a figure or discussion question dealing with this point. Then select a teaching approach. The table of Student-Active Approaches includes suggestions for all class sizes. Although population change on different time scales, from interannual to interdecadal and longer, is an important aspect of ecology, it is often difficult to interest students in this topic.

o In a small class you can ask students to answer a short list of questions 
(in class âÃÃ¬ not as homework). Be clear that this is not a test, is 
anonymous, and has no bearing on their grade. Tell the class that it
will help you better design the course for them. Students can write 
very short essays about questions such as ""In a well known National 
Forest, the numbers of birds has gone up and down repeatedly over
the last 15 years. Do you think that these changes in bird numbers 
very likely indicate some kind of environmental problem? Briefly 
explain why or why not.
"" You can also use multiple-choice questions 
as described below. 
o In larger classes, it is harder but not impossible to ask students to write 
short essays. A real benefit of polling large classes is the large N. You 
can hand out index cards, pose the essay question described above, 
and simply ask students to drop the cards in a box as they leave the 
classroom. (Again, explain that this is not a test and is anonymous). 
You donâÃÃ´t need to look at all the cards; you can randomly sample them 
until the answers become repetitive. 
o In any size class, you can also use multiple-choice questions. The 
question above could be modified with choices, such as: (a) yes, 
because healthy environments do not vary like that, (b) maybe, 
because healthy environments probably should not vary like that, (c) 
no, because numbers of some birds naturally change a lot, and (d) no 
idea. 
2. Step Two: Intervention (your teaching) âÃÃ® Use the Barange article in a 
class session, being sure to clearly bring out the idea that large inter-annual and 
inter-decadal changes in population density can be quite normal. 
3. Step Three: Post-test âÃÃ® Decide on a way to assess your studentsâÃÃ´ learning
in regard to the misconception. This could be through a brief essay or multiple-
choice question similar to the ones described above but specifically concerning 
information from the Barange article. Another way is to give students a new

At the completion of these activities, students will:
1. have improved their ability to use BLAST;
2. be able to identify genomic islands from whole-genome
alignments;
3. know one way to explore existing annotation for genes in
a genomic island and determine whether any are involved
in virulence;
4. be able to conduct analyses addressing conservation of vir-
ulence factors in Escherichia coli O157:H7 or Yersinia pestis
strains; and
5. be able to apply these newly acquired skills to design a
bioinformatic investigation of an E. coli outbreak.",," In
this paper, we present two educational modules designed to enable students to learn and apply
fundamental concepts in comparative genomics using examples related to bacterial pathogenesis.
Students first examine alignments of genomes of Escherichia coli O157:H7 strains isolated from three
food-poisoning outbreaks using the multiple-genome alignment tool Mauve. Students investigate
conservation of virulence factors using the Mauve viewer and by browsing annotations available at
the A Systematic Annotation Package for Community Analysis of Genomes database. In the second
module, students use an alignment of five Yersinia pestis genomes to analyze single-nucleotide poly-
morphisms of three genes to classify strains into biovar groups. Students are then given sequences
of bacterial DNA amplified from the teeth of corpses from the first and second pandemics of the
bubonic plague and asked to classify these new samples",,Formative assessment; Exam; Summative Assessment; Other,"pre/post test: learning assessment, self-efficacy, skills, content knowledge","Formative assessment: ""Our formative assessment data confirmed that almost all
students were able to determine conservation of an assigned virulence gene across numerous E. coli O157:H7 genomes, but students were somewhat less competent at using BLAST to address the question ""Is this gene or a homolog found in other Enterobacteria?"" (Tables 3 and 5).""

Exam: ""To determine the extent to which our student learning objectives were achieved, we used a variety of assessment
instruments, including pre- and postmodule knowledge based questionnaires, scoring of student responses to guided inquiry-based individual assignments, and open-ended investigations/exam questions that required students to apply their newly acquired abilities and their understanding of core concepts, such as the potential functions of virulence factors or the effects of SNPs on metabolic capabilities.""

Summative assessment: ""The posttest data revealed that 92% or 84% of students surveyed gained confidence in using a Mauve multiple-genome alignment to identify a genomic island upon completion of one or both exercises, respectively (P < 0.0001; Table 2). ""

The 16 questions assess subject matter knowledge of synthetic biology and the BioBrick system (Q 1âÃÃ¬6), technical skills relevant to molecular biology techniques (Q 7, 8, 11, 12), information literacy (Q 9, 10), the interdisciplinary nature of synthetic biology (Q 13), social implications of synthetic biology (Q 14), and preferential impact of the course on the students (Q 15, 16). 
Additionally, five graded Progress Report assignments include free-response questions that specifically address experimental and procedural outcomes as well as assessment of learning outcomes. The series of five Progress Report assignments are included in Appendix 5, and are keyed to be completed in weeks 3, 5, 7, 10, and 12. Student responses to select questions in these assignments are mapped to the five Learning Outcomes and can be evaluated on a point-based rubric reflecting core concepts (Appendix 6).

""The design of this lab is inclusive for all students across personality types. It actively encourages group learning, but also provides a path for independent students to work on their projects on their own if they wish. Furthermore, because the students are designing their own questions, choosing their own testing locations, and making their own media, the class is inclusive for all students across different disciplines 
(e.g., a public health professional can swab different surfaces of the classroom, while an athletic nutrition major may test agar medias with various concentrations of sugar). This allows students to apply what they are learning about biology and the scientific method in a way that applies to their future careers and goals, making the lecture material much more likely to stick with them.

""The CURE developed through this laboratory lesson is inherently inclusive because of how well it serves the 
community college population. Courses implementing this laboratory lesson are designed for first- and second-year undergraduate students majoring in biology and/or allied health, as well as students majoring in non-science fields. Implementation of this laboratory lesson was primarily at Century College, a community college. Importantly, this laboratory lesson provides a research experience for community college and introductory level students, who ordinarily do not have the chance to participate in primary 
research. When designing the project, we were mindful of the inherent cultural and socioeconomic diversity, particularly of our community college student population.

Engaging community college students in research has been shown to benefit students in a variety of ways, including their transfer to four-year STEM programs, and several research programs targeting community college students are successfully implemented (31,32). Despite the focus on competency-based and experiential learning in higher education, it is still relatively uncommon for community college students to conduct primary, original research on the large scale that this lesson provides. According to data from 
the American Association of Community Colleges in 2012, an estimated 12.8 million students enrolled at a community college, accounting for 45% of all undergraduates in the United States. 56% of STEM undergraduate students attended a community college at some point of their studies (31). These 
large enrollment numbers underscore the increasing impact that community colleges are having on the undergraduate education of in the United States. Community college students vary greatly in age and other demographic variables such as income and ethnicity. According to the American Association of Community Colleges, the average age of the community college student population is 28 with approximately 36% 
enrolled as first-generation college students (33). Moreover, 36% of community college students receive Pell grants. In 2015, at Century College, approximately 55% of the students at the community college were first generation college students with little or no previous exposure to science courses (34).

While the lesson is inherently inclusive, there are also varieties of specific activities that will accommodate the needs of students with diverse learning styles. From development of the group hypotheses to analysis of results, the laboratory lesson is collaborative, ""easing the way"" to scientific experimentation for students. Students learn how to balance an âÃÃ²idealâÃÃ´ experimental design with feasibility, specifically of obtaining soil samples from locations to which students have access. Discussion throughout the laboratory lesson 
emphasizes the prevalence and timely importance of spread of antibiotic resistance in the environment as it relates to the greater community. In addition, pedagogical approaches implemented in this laboratory lesson accommodate a variety of learning styles through the use of demonstrations, videos, hands on lab activities, mini-lectures, worksheets, and case studies.""",,,Yes,,Yes,,"Learning Goal(s)

""This laboratory lesson uses multiple approaches to engage students in active learning. After brainstorming ideas in groups of four to six, students work together as a lab section to develop a unified hypothesis regarding the relative frequency of antibiotic-resistance genes in local soils. The students are first asked to examine the hypothesis based on feasibility and then vote on one hypothesis for that lab section. This approach engages students in a discussion of experimental design and hypothesis development. During the 
laboratory periods, students complete worksheets with questions that highlight concepts and techniques used in that laboratory. Students start analyzing the data on their own and then discuss their ideas and interpretations in lab, with peers and an instructor.

""In the pre-class assignment, students answer reading comprehension questions based on background reading. During the in-class portion of the lesson, students engage in self-evaluations. Specifically, students are asked to predict the dynamics of a model, test their predictions with the simulation, report on their observations, and interpret the results in terms of a cellular mechanism. Students self-evaluate whether or 
not their prediction was correct before moving on. Finally, summative assessment can include grading responses to the questions in the lesson.

concept important to undergraduate education (AAAS 2011). Students will apply a 
theoretical framework that underlies the study of animal behavior, namely how a 
behavior, such as foraging or breeding, is ultimately enacted by individuals of a 
population. While genetics determines the behaviors available to the animal, multiple 
strategies are typically available and which one an animal chooses is likely the outcome 
of many trials and errors. The costs and benefits of these strategies can be modeled 
using basic economics so that the animal can maximize efficiency or fitness. This 
simulation game offers an opportunity to students to explore the consequences of 
individuals acting on different strategies. Fitness rewards are represented by candy or 
some other ""treat"" and those individuals with the most rewards at the end of the game 
would enjoy the greatest fitness

mathematical models to simulate dynamics in animal behavior, students will learn how 
optimal strategies may evolve and how scientists can test theoretical models depicting 
these strategies and their expected outcomes

With an intent to create a rich learning experience in molecular genetics, we developed a semester-long course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE) using the CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing system to disrupt specific genes in the zebrafish. The course was offered to freshman students; nine students worked in four groups (two to three members per group) to design, synthesize, and test the nuclease activity of the CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats)/sgRNAs for targeted disruption of specific genes in the zebrafish. Each group worked with a gene with an already known mutant phenotype that can be visually scored and a gene that had not been studied in zebrafish previously. Embedded in the course were a series of workshop-styled units or tutorials, including tours to core facilities. The focus was on introducing and developing skills that could be accommodated within the span of a semester. Each group successfully cloned at least one plasmid-encoding CRISPR/sgRNA template, visually analyzed injected embryos, and performed genotyping assays to detect CRISPR-Cas9 activity. In-class discussions, a final end-of-semester written test, and group oral presentations were assessed for an understanding of the CRISPR-Cas9 system, application of the CRISPR-Cas9 system as a gene manipulation tool, and experimental methods used to create plasmid vectors and synthesize sgRNA. In addition, poster presentations were evaluated by faculty, graduate students, and senior undergraduate students at a University research exposition. Self-reflections in the form of group conversations were video recorded. All students (9/9) distinctly showed learning gains after completing the activity, but the extent of the gains was variable, as seen from results of a written test and poster presentation assessment.

Without a solid foundation in these concepts, students would not be able to proceed with the hands-on bench research.

This activity meets the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS 
Lead States, 2013a, b), and there are several Cross-cutting Concepts 
and Science and Engineering Practices that are met via this activ-
ity (see Table 1). Moreover, because one of the four main factors of 
natural selection is ""competition for limited resources"" (HS-LS4-2, 
p. 91), one of the objectives is for students to be able to explain the 
importance of competition by using a historical example. In order to 
meet this objective, we assumed that students should already have 
a basic understanding of evolution, natural selection, and ecology. 
Therefore, in our introductory biology course, students completed 
this activity toward the end of the evolution unit, which was after 
the ecology unit. 
The other main objective, an NOS concept included in the Next 
Generation Science Standards, is for students to be able to identify that 
""scientific investigations use a variety of methods"" (NGSS Lead States, 
2013: Appendix H, p. 4). For instance, science can be explored in the 
field, not just in a laboratory, and science can occur via observations
Experiments are not always necessary and are sometimes even 
impractical. To illustrate these points, we chose to model a histori-
cal example. Before making comparisons between experiments and 
other methods of science, we advise that students learn what a true 
experiment entails (e.g., having a control and an experimental vari-
able) in a previous lesson, as we have found that some students inter-
change the terms ""science"" and ""experiment.""",," Introduction (~5 minutes)

format, in which students gained familiarity with 
neurovirology content before class, and used class time for 
active learning strategies (Mazur, 2009; Brame, 2013). 
Appendix A provides details on before class readings, 
videos, and assignments, and in-class activites for the 
neurovirology module. 


Week 1 and Week 2 class time used cooperative, 
student-led learning, where students worked together to 
complete questions based on the before class content 
(Davidson and Major, 2014). Specifically, students were 
randomly assigned to groups of 3-4 using the breakout room 
function in Zoom. Each group was assigned a different set 
of instructor-created questions to discuss and complete in a 
shared Google Slides document, and the instructor 
circulated between groups to check understanding. Then, 
each group presented their answers to the full class. This 
format provided structure for students to create their own 
study guide summarizing neurovirology content, and 
provided additional practice in cooperative, student-led 
learning (Davidson and Major, 2014).

Weeks 3-4 of the neurovirology module were used for the 
case study assignment. Broadly defined, case studies use 
narratives to engage students and meet learning objectives 
(Herreid, 2007). 

Briefly, 
students worked in self-selected groups of 2-3 to write their 
case study on any neurovirulent virus of their choosing.

other student group, and the case study authors led their

#5 Ability to Communicate and Collaborate with other Disciplines
The use of a fictional narrative in a science classroom automatically falls within the 
""other Discipline"" category. Students can be asked to assess if and how their learning was 
affected by their reading of fiction. Did fiction allow a deeper or different exploration of the 
topic? Does fiction facilitate discussion? Does a danger exist in using fiction to explore scientific 
topics? Should scientists learn to communicate in different styles? What would be the 
advantage of these different communication styles? How can interdisciplinary collaboration be
mutually beneficial? 
#6 Ability to Understand the Relationship between Science and Society
This assignment is designed to have students grapple with the relationship between 
science and society. Their understanding can be assessed by the short answer questions related 
to character perspectives and their own personal viewpoint. Students can also be asked what 
scientific information is needed to better evaluate responsibility, which is more of a societal 
construct.

towards narrower answerable ones, developing hypotheses, designing and 
conducting a field-based research project to answer these questions, using skills 
in experimental design and data analysis, e.g., use of spreadsheets, simple 
statistics, data reduction, developing clear figures and tables that address 
specific questions, and generating a formatted paper or presentation based on 
their research findings).
4. Advance their scientific critical thinking skills by revising their initial questions and 
hypotheses due to their findings as well as findings by others in published 
literature. 
5. Learn how to read scientific literature and place their work within its scientific 
context. 
6. Advance their skills in scientific collaboration within their peer community. 
7. Advance their skills in communicating scientific findings to peers (written and/or 
oral) presentation of research results). ",,"Students spend two four-hour lab sessions on this project. A field trip is made to the

your classroom. ""Being explicit about oneâÃÃ´s goal of cultivating 
an inclusive, equitable, and fair classroom learning environment 
reiterates that students and instructors are on the same side, 
not on somehow opposing sides, of the teaching and learning 
process"" and ""all students are explicitly welcomed into the 
intellectual discussion of biology"" (28). Emphasize to your 
students that you, as the instructor, are committed to an 
inclusive classroom environment. To ensure inclusiveness tell 
your students that the course is structured in such a way to 
facilitate this outcome. Impress upon your students that scientific 
investigation is a collaborative effort that requires multiple 
inputs and talents. Tell them we each bring unique abilities and 
experiences to any situation, and that our success, as a class, on 
the Streptomyces project requires that each person contribute 
and that we as a class value each otherâÃÃ´s unique contribution 
and perspective. Remind your students that it is your hope, as 
their instructor, that all of them will become the next generation 
of scientific investigators committed to the scientific method 
and evidence-based decision making. Tell them that they will 
become the diverse face of the next generation of scientists (28).
In addition, as the instructor, it is important that you recognize 
the diversity in your classroom. Your classâÃÃ´s diversity may include 
some of the following differences: race, class, poverty, gender, 
disability, and privilege or disenfranchisement (29). Before 
asking students to introduce themselves and identify diversity 
issues important to them you, as their instructor, can provide a 
comfortable classroom environment by introducing yourself to 
the class. Describe your background and diversity issues you 
deem important to create an inclusive classroom environment. 
You might also include a diversity statement in your syllabus.

Once you have initiated the discussion on diversity encourage 
your students to introduce themselves to the class at the 
beginning of the semester. Give them a chance to say who 
they are and what they hope to gain and give to the class. 
In addition, students should be encouraged to speak to you 
privately to assess their learning, progress, and concerns for the 
class. You should also ask them, during an office meeting, about 
their learning style, do they work best alone, or in a group. Do 
they excel at oral or written work? Let them know that you are 
available to meet with them in person, during office hours, or by 
email correspondence. Tell them that the class will provide an 
opportunity for them to participate and excel in different ways and that you want them to tell you if they are uncomfortable, for 
any reason, during class and what things you as the instructor 
can do to facilitate their learning. In short, they matter to you 
as individuals.
Students work in groups of 2-4. This establishes a small 
community of learners in which each student can feel safe and 
included. I assign members to each group based on my prior 
knowledge of their prior research experience and observation 
of their engagement with their major. Some students have 
extensive out of class research experience, and these students 
should not group together. If students self-select the groups 
become homogenous and therefore do not reflect the diversity 
of the classroom.
As an example of an inclusive learning environment during 
LAB 3 and 4, students examine each otherâÃÃ´s work and then 
decide together which of their soil isolates most closely 
resembles a Streptomyces bacterium. These groups prepare 
a short in-lab presentation that gives each student a voice. It 
allows students who might be reluctant to speak to the entire 
class by themselves, to be part of a supportive group presentation 
that represents their work. This allows students with different 
learning styles (interactive group work as opposed to individual 
noninteractive work) to benefit from an interactive learning 
environment. This opportunity arises several times during the 
semester when students present their hypotheses regarding their 
groupâÃÃ´s laboratory work and their data. This Lesson also employs 
peer instruction which promotes an inclusive environment as 
each student brings different skills to the group and therefore 
adds value to each personâÃÃ´s contribution.
Finally, as the instructor, you should take time to point out 
the diversity among Streptomyces investigators. HopwoodâÃÃ´s 
Streptomyces in Nature and Medicine (8) provides an excellent 
resource documenting this point and the power of cooperative 
scientific investigation. I cannot emphasize enough how 
useful and important HopwoodâÃÃ´s book is, as a resource, 
and to impress upon students the diversity inherent in the 
international Streptomyces project. The text highlights the 
international cooperation, among female and male scientists 
of different nationalities, brought together at the John Innes 
Centre in England. Individual investigators are described and 
given credit for their contributions. The book demonstrates the 
power of both diversity and cooperative investigation. I point 
out to students the names of individuals who contributed to the 
International Streptomyces project. For example, Hee-Jeon Hong 
from Korea working with Mark Buttner, from the John Innes 
Center in Norwich UK, discover one pathway for resistance 
to the antibiotic vancomycin (8, 30) and Janet Westpheling 
working with Xianyang Ni, from the University of Georgia in 
Athens, Georgia who together examine the promoter region 
of the Streptomyces chitinase gene (8, 15). These are not 
household names, but they are known in Streptomyces biology 
and demonstrate to students the diversity and collaborative 
nature of scientific investigation. There are many more examples 
and I strongly encourage you to obtain a copy of this book.

can also contribute to an inclusive learning environment (26, 

27, 28, and 6). In this Lesson, an active learning environment 

is fostered by several activities that focus on increasing course 

structure as a tool to promote active learning (6). These include: 

1. Graded preparatory assignments, 2. Formulation, by students, 

of testable hypotheses with in class presentations, 3. Graded 

practice problems with in class presentation, 4. Small group 

work in which students think, pair, and share, 5. Independent 

data analysis followed by evidence-based-decision-making 

and, 6. Peer instruction.

Prior to several of the laboratory exercises (LAB # 2, 3, 6, 

and 8), students are asked (prompted) to read a research paper, 

refer to their text, class notes, or a supporting file and use the 

information in their reading to formulate (on their own) a short-

written hypothesis or an explanation relevant to work in the 

next laboratory period. This provides additional structure to the 

laboratory by giving individual students time to think about the 

subject matter outside of class and then, either hand in their 

written work or upon arriving in class, share their thoughts 

with group members and the class (28). Specifically, in several 

of the lab sessions, student groups examine the results of their 

previous weekâÃÃ´s work and see whether the results support 

their hypothesis. After a few minutes of small group discussion 

(students are assigned by the instructor to a small group of 

2-4 students) students in each group present their ideas to the 

rest of the class. Student presenters can take turns during the 

presentation or rotate during the semester as working groups 

are set for the semester. Either of these presentation methods 

allows evaluation of each student by the instructor.

In addition to formulating testable hypotheses and in class 

presentations related to the laboratory work, students are 

also given homework assignments related to the next weekâÃÃ´s 

laboratory. Homework assignments also increase course 

structure, promoting active learning (26, 6). Specifically, students 

are asked to come to class with serial dilution calculations 

relating to that dayâÃÃ´s work (LAB 3). Based on their own 

calculations and outside reading students are asked to predict 

which serial dilution of their soil sample will yield countable 

plates and the type of microbial growth that will occur on the 

different media. Their predictions are then compared against 

the actual plate count and type of growth. This work can also 

be presented orally in class (time permitting) or handed in if 

desired as one of several formative assessment assignments.

In addition to measuring microbial numbers and type in 

their soil sample, the studentsâÃÃ´ main goal is to isolate and 

characterize a Streptomyces in pure culture. Examination 

of their plates, individually and with their group members, 

promotes evidence-based decision making. The group needs to 

arrive at a consensus, based on observable colonial features of 

each otherâÃÃ´s bacterial isolate. Students then decide collectively, 

which isolate (isolates) most closely resemble a Streptomyces
. 

At this point, I ask the students to call me over to examine their 

isolates and help in their decision regarding which colony is most likely a Streptomyces. In addition, students may decide to 

share their isolate with one of their classmates if they have been 

more successful in isolating a suspected Streptomyces. This also 

facilitates a sense of community and shared goal.

Finally, peer instruction is also an element of active learning 

by adding structure to the laboratory setting (28). The small 

group work that students do throughout the semester allows 

them to assist each other during their laboratory work. This 

actively engages all students in the project and increases their 

""stake"" in the work. Peer instruction also promotes an inclusive 

environment as each student brings different skills to the group 

and therefore adds value to each personâÃÃ´s contribution.",,Formative assessment; Exam; Paper / report / problem set; Presentation; Worksheet; Summative Assessment,,"This Lesson makes use of both formative and summative 

assessment tools to evaluate student learning. Within these 

two categories this Lesson employs, assessment of individual 

student performance, homework assignments, in-class oral 

presentation, multiple choice questions on the final exam, and 

a comprehensive laboratory report at the end of the project. At 

the beginning of the semester, I assign students to working groups 

based on my knowledge about them, their engagement with 

the major and previous research experience. As microbiology 

is a junior/senior level biology major course I may have known 

these students for 2-3 years. This allows me to form groups in 

which each member brings different strengths. I do not allow 

students to self-select their group, as this often results in groups 

that lack diversity. To ensure that all students participate in the 

group work, and can be individually assessed, (during the in-

class presentations) each student in the group is required to 

present part of the groupâÃÃ´s work. Students are also told that each 

of them must participate equally in their groupâÃÃ´s presentation. If 

this is not possible, due to time constraints, the group can agree 

to rotate the ""reporter"" for each in-lab presentation.

In addition, as part of a formative assessment tool, students 

are asked to formulate testable hypotheses at several times 

during the semester-long project. During laboratory #2 and 

#3, students work in groups of two to four, depending on 

class size, to develop and present their hypotheses concerning 

type of microbial growth they anticipate on different culture 

media. This work requires that students demonstrate both a 

knowledge of relevant literature, as detailed in the lesson plan, 

and the proper interpretation of their results from the previous 

weekâÃÃ´s work. Classroom presentations also allow students to 

compare their work to other groups in the class and engage 

in self-reflection. During laboratory #6 (isolation of antibiotic 

producing strains of Streptomyces) students are again asked to 

work in their groups (for 10-15 minutes) to suggest reason(s) for 

the observed differences in antibiotic sensitivity between Gram-

positive and Gram-negative bacteria. This allows the students to 

make connections between their observed laboratory results and 

lecture discussions on the structure of the Gram-positive and 

Gram-negative cell wall. Additionally, formative assessments 

also contribute to an inclusive learning environment. Each 

student in the group can contribute to the groupâÃÃ´s hypothesis 

and presentation of their results to the entire class.

The summative assessment tool is a detailed laboratory 

report on the semester-long investigation. To facilitate the 

writing of this report students are required to keep a detailed 

laboratory notebook throughout the semester. Students receive 

a comprehensive guide (Supporting file S12: Dirt to DNA - Laboratory Report Outline.) describing the requirements for 

their final report. This outline also serves as a rubric for the 

instructor and ensures uniform grading among the students. As 

described above, the final laboratory report on the Streptomyces

comprises 1/3 of the studentâÃÃ´s final laboratory grade. In addition, 

a comprehensive written final laboratory exam contains multiple 

choice questions on the Streptomyces and interpretation of 

laboratory results. The method used to assign point values to 

each student (letter grade, point value, or percent) is up to the 

individual instructor and their overall grading system for the 

class. The laboratory portion of my class accounts for 30% of 

the overall microbiology course grade. In class presentations and 

written assignments account for 10% of the laboratory grade. 

The final laboratory report on the Streptomyces accounts for an 

additional 10% of the laboratory grade and the comprehensive 

multiple choice final laboratory exam counts for the remaining 

10% of the laboratory grade.",,Yes,"Cited as supplemental materials, supporting materials, or in an appendix",,Easy,

students wrote a rough draft of their lab report using a substantive rubric to guide the content. In a structured visit with a 
peer writing tutor, students received feedback on sentence structure; and the inclusion of traditional conventions of a lab 
report such as a testable hypothesis, explanation of the results in relation to the hypothesis, and a description of the results 
and their variation in testable groups. After submitting and receiving a grade on their rough draft, the students reflected on 
the strengths and areas for improvement of their rough drafts followed by a discussion of questions that they had regarding

Adapted from the Visions and Changes Core Competencies (1) 
""Students will improve communication with others through scientific 
writing"" through the guided formation of a traditional lab report 
within four areas:
âÃÂ¢ sentence structure
âÃÂ¢ adherence to the conventions of a traditional structure of a 
lab report with special attention to: the inclusion of a testable 
hypothesis; summary and comparison of testable variable groups 
on the results section; and a biological explanation of the results 
that answer the testable hypothesis

Learning Objective(s)
âÃÂ¢ Students will be able to write a lab report that contains a 
descriptive title, complete and concise abstract, substantive 
and relevant introduction that includes a testable hypothesis, 
descriptive methods, description and comparison of results of 
various testable groups, biological explanation of the results that 
reflect the testable hypothesis, a conclusion that contains societal 
implications or scientific impact, and references cited in the 
document.

their writing.
âÃÂ¢ Students will understand how to utilize office hours and the writing 
center to receive feedback on their lab reports.",,"
There were three 
learning methodologies that students 
used while completing the 
learning objectives. The first 
methodology was a creation of rough and final lab report 
based on an in-class experiment. The lab report included a 
descriptive title, complete and concise abstract, substantive 
and relevant introduction that included a testable hypothesis, 
descriptive methods, description and comparison of testable 
groups in the results, biological explanation of the results 
that reflected the testable hypothesis in the discussion, a 
conclusion that contained societal implications or scientific 
impact, and a bibliography that included only references 
cited in the document. The substantive rubric also provided 
guidance on what information to include in the lab report.

Visits to the writing center and office hours provide students structured reflection and low-stakes feedback on scientific writing in an Introductory Biology course.
The second methodology was self-reflection. In preparation 
for the visit to the writing center, students wrote a reflection 
self-identifying concerns in their writing. Upon receiving a 
grade for the rough drafts of their lab reports and before the 
visit to office hours, students also completed another written 
reflection of the areas of improvements and strengths of the 
report as well as outlined questions regarding the assessment 
of their lab reports.
The 
third methodology was 
structured one-on-one 
interactions with a peer writing tutor and myself to provide 
students low-stakes feedback regarding the sentence structure 
and inclusion of the basic tenants of a well written laboratory 
report with special attention to a testable hypothesis, summary 
and comparison of testable groups in the results, and biological 
explanation of the results in the discussion that match the 
testable hypothesis.",,Formative assessment; Paper / report / problem set; Other,written reflections and meetings,"
I assessed 
learning via multiple assignments 
including 
written reflections, one-on-one interactions with a writing 
tutor and myself, and the rough and final drafts of a lab report. 
I used a substantive rubric (Supporting File S1: Example 
grading rubric for the rough and final drafts of the lab report) 
to assess the rough draft and final drafts of the lab report. The 
rough and final drafts were 5 and 10% of the course grade, 
respectively. The final two assessments described below were 
assessed based on the completion of the tasks listed in the 
document and were worth a total of 3.6% of the course grade. 
For the second assignment, students self-evaluated three 
areas of concern in their lab reports that they would like to 
discuss with a writing tutor or with myself during office hours 
(Supporting File S3: Writing Center handout- guidance for visit 
to the writing center and Supporting File S4: Office Hours 
handout- guidance for office hours visit, respectively). Finally, 
students participated in one-on-one discussions first with a 
writing tutor and then with the instructor to receive feedback 
on their scientific writing and discuss any concerns regarding 
the lab report. During the writing center visit, students also 
had an opportunity to discuss if the lab reports contained a 
testable hypothesis, summary and comparison of testable 
groups in the results, biological explanation of the results in the 
discussion that match the testable hypothesis. They were also 
able to discuss any other component of the lab report. During 
the office hours visit, students could discuss the strengths and

Neural control of walking is particularly difficult to understand because the interaction of the cerebral cortex with a central pattern generator (CPG) makes the mode of control context-dependent. Beginning students tend to consider corticospinal control the basis of all movement, so they may not distinguish the limited circumstances in which the cerebral cortex bypasses the CPG to control leg movements directly for walking. The demonstration described here is designed to show that cortical involvement in normal walking is minimal unless visual control of foot placement is required. Cortical involvement in motor control is assessed by probing for spare attention while a student volunteer performs three different tasks: sitting, walking down a hallway, and walking through an obstacle course. Simple math quizzes with 20 oral questions are the probes. The class observes the demonstration and discusses the results. To evaluate learning, a multiple-choice question was administered two months after the demonstration, as well as 14 months later to cohorts from the previous yearÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs class. The demonstration succeeded: quiz scores were similar for sitting and level walking, but lower for the obstacle course. Two months later, 86% of students correctly answered the multiple choice question; 42% of the previous yearÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs cohorts answered correctly after 14 months. The demonstration shows that the cortex is engaged by walking through an obstacle course, not walking on a flat indoor surface. Initially, most students learned this distinction well, but after a year, many reverted to the idea that the corticospinal tract controls details of leg movements during walking. Thus this result emphasizes the need for review of advanced concepts. Overall, the experience was fun and could easily fit into basic or clinical neuroscience courses.",9786,,"The Ohio

This article describes a simple demonstration
that helps students understand which situations require
extensive involvement of the corticospinal system for the
control of walking and which modes of walking may be
governed with only minor involvement at the level of the 
cortex","
The math quiz used as the probe consisted of 20 
questions requiring three numbers to be added or 
subtracted, such as 19 + 17 - 14 = ? The quiz questions 
were randomly constructed so that the answers could
range from -50 to +50, and the three addends in each 
equation could range from -30 to +30. To deliver the quiz, 
the instructor read a question aloud to the student, the
student replied with an answer, and then the next question
was asked. The student was not told whether the answers 
were correct as the quiz proceeded, but the instructor
recorded responses as right or wrong on a tally sheet. The
student was given two minutes to answer as many 
questions as possible. If the student finished all 20 
questions within two minutes, the instructor used the time 
remaining to go back and re-ask questions that were
initially missed. The score was the number of correct 
replies. In four years, students typically had a chance to 
retry only a few questions within the two-minute time 
frame; no one has reached 100% (20 correct) within two
minutes. 
To compare the demands of normal locomotion and
navigating an obstacle course, three versions of the quiz 
were constructed. As illustrated in Fig. 1, a student
volunteer took the first quiz while sitting, with her or his 
classmates watching. Next, the same volunteer took the
second quiz while walking up and down the hallway, again
with her or his classmates watching. Finally, the student
took a third version of the quiz while walking back and forth
through an obstacle course set up in the hallway, also with 
their classmates watching. 
The actual quizzes are
presented in Appendix 1. 
The obstacle course was about 10 meters long and
included an assortment of items such as boxes, balls,
books, chairs, foam and step-stools that the student had to 
step upon or over (Fig. 1). Any assortment of items will
suffice, as long as they present a challenging obstacle 
course that a reasonably coordinated individual can walk
though without having to use their hands. In requesting a
volunteer, the instructor should ask for a student with no 
balance impairments or lower limb orthopedic problems. 
Buford Cortical Involvement in Walking A54
For administration of the quiz in sitting, the student sat 
in a chair and the instructor stood at the front of the 
classroom. For walking up and down the hall and for the 
obstacle course, the instructor stood about midway down
the course. In each case, the instructor used a loud, clear 
voice to ask the questions
.
 An effort was made to ask the 
questions at about the same pace in all three conditions.
Students were encouraged not to pause to answer
questions, but to keep walking at a steady pace. 
As described in results, the demonstration worked: 
quiz scores were similar for sitting and walking in the hall,
but lower for walking through the obstacle course. After 
the demonstration, students worked in groups of two to
four to develop written responses to the following question: 
""Explain the differences in results based on the degree of
cortical involvement in each activity."" After providing a few 
minutes for the students to develop their answers, the 
instructor asked for volunteers to recite their explanations 
to the class. In the ensuing discussion, concepts about
neural control of walking were reinforced, and applications
of these concepts to rehabilitation were introduced.
",,Quiz; Summative Assessment,,"To determine whether this demonstration 
was 
effective, a one-question post-test was administered two

and could not discuss it with each other. The question was 
as follows
. 
During walking, which of the following circumstances would 
most likely require involvement of the cerebral cortex for 
the control of specific aspects of the leg movements?
a. Walking indoors down a quiet hallway 
b. Walking outdoors on a smooth asphalt pathway 
c. Walking outdoors on a badly broken sidewalk
d. All of the above âÃÃ¬ the cerebral cortex controls all
voluntary movement 
e. None of the above âÃÃ¬ a central pattern generator 
controls walking 
The correct answer is c. Walking on a badly broken
sidewalk, which is analogous to walking through an
obstacle course, demands cortical control over specific
aspects of the leg movements. In the context of cortical
control of locomotion, there is nothing special about 
walking indoors or outdoors when the surface is level and 
unobstructed. Thus, answers a and b established a
contrast, emphasizing the ""badly broken sidewalk"" in
answer c. Although it is true that the cerebral cortex is 
involved in the control of all voluntary movement, the key 
phrase in the stem, ""control of specific aspects of the leg
movements,"" makes answer d wrong in the context of 
locomotor control. Answer e is also wrong in this context 
because the CPG is not sufficient to fully govern 
locomotion for the situation described in answer c. Thus,
answers d and e were designed to find students who had 
overgeneralized and forgotten the contingencies for 
interaction between the cerebral cortex and the CPG for 
control of walking",,Yes,"Cited as supplemental materials, supporting materials, or in an appendix",The math quiz was in an appendix,Neutral,"Barring the fact that I don't have a great read on what level of student would be doing this, it seems like a productive experience."

my students, receiving positive marks in our course 
evaluations.",Several class/lab periods; Other,out of class,,No,,No Hits,,No,,No,,,"While everything makes sense, and an overarching goal of improving neuroscience wikipedia entries is present, the learning goals aren't explicit.

Actually, the end of semester student assessment in Table 2 articulates some goals:

1. The Wikipedia assignment improved my knowledge of neuroscience 
4. The Wikipedia assignment improved my overall writing skills 
5. I am likely to continue to edit Wikipedia articles in the future. 

","After the students register, they are responsible for 
choosing a stub to work on from a list that I provide them 
on our course page. The students work in groups of 3 to 4, 
so before the semester starts I will research some of the 
stubs that are listed on the Neuroscience stubs page and 
choose 40-50 of them to index on our course page for 
possible student selection. To choose that stub and 
indicate to other students that it is no longer available, they 
are required to list their names (hyperlinked to their
Wikipedia accounts where our class project is described)
next to the stub itself.
 
Before choosing a stub, the students must view the 
information that already exists for that stub and through 
PubMed and Google Scholar searches determine if they 
are interested in the topic, and also if sufficient volume and 
quality of scientific literature resources exists to improve it
.
In general, the Wikipedia editorial community prefers 
secondary literature resources as opposed to primary to 
ensure in part that majority views in the peer reviewed 
literature are also majority views in Wikipedia. There can 
be negative consequences to this policy. 
For instance, 
new hypotheses in the peer reviewed literature, which may 
be perfectly valid, that have not yet been addressed in 
review articles may not be given appropriate weight in 
Wikipedia. But this policy also avoids misrepresentation of 
poorly performed scientific research that is not well 
received by the scientific community.
 
During the next (4
th
) week of class, a one-page proposal 
must be posted to a subpage under the studentâÃÃ´s main 
page. The proposal consists of points to be covered in the 
article, a short list of resources, and how the students will 
divide up the workload within their group. The subpage
where this information is posted is not in the Wikipedia 
mainspace, meaning that these pages are not stored and 
searched in the same way as articles on Wikipedia. This is 
important, as these types of 
""
sandbox"" pages where 
students are developing works in progress are speedily 
deleted if they are posted in the mainspace
. 
This is clearly 
laid out in our course page
. 
I believe that this is one of the 
more important points to pay close attention to by anyone 
 looking 
to undertake a similar project.
STUB IMPROVEMENT
During the next five weeks, the students work on 
developing factual improvements to the stub, as well as 
learning how Wiki markup language works to properly
format text and images
. 
The markup language is quite 
easy to learn, and there are many help resources available 
through Wikipedia, both electronic as well as people who 
have indicated a willingness to help out with problems that 
may arise. Indeed, I have listed our course project on two 
separate educational compendia (http://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Category:Wikipedia_school_and_university_projects)
and (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:United_States_
Education_Program), through which 
I have found 
Wikipedia ""ambassadors"" that have been willing to help out 
remotely, or even to meet with my students in person, as 
several of the worldwide representatives are in the Boston 
area. 
 
I have tried two separate ways for my students to work 
on their article during this five-week period of ""rough draft 
mode"". They can collaborate inside of one of the group 
membersâÃÃ´ sandbox pages, putting together the individual 
pieces they are working on away from the attention of the 
general public who may be searching for information 
regarding their particular stub. Alternatively, the students 
can make their changes to the ""live"" Wikipedia article on 
the stub page that currently exists. There are positive and
negatives to each of these approaches. If the students 
tend to work piecemeal and add to their article in stages on 
the live page, editors from outside the course may see 
individual sections showing up on the live article that are 
not well integrated because all of the individuals in the 
group have not yet completed their work. This may lead
those editors to make changes to the article even before 
they have seen the studentsâÃÃ´ completed work. We have 
found that if the students leave a notice on the articleâÃÃ´s talk 
page indicating that the article is being updated over the 
course of a given number of days, most outside editors will 
wait until that period has passed before making changes of 
their own. Alternatively, if a large amount of work is put 
together in the studentsâÃÃ´ sandbox over the course of 
several weeks and then made live in one instance, there 
may have been changes made to the stub by outside 
editors during those weeks that the students are not 
incorporating into their work. This is not always a bad thing 
if the students
âÃÃ´ 
work is of higher quality than the recent 
additions to the stub and also incorporates the same 
general concepts. I instruct my students to use the articleâÃÃ´s 
talk page to announce all intended substantial changes to 
the article before they are made, which allows all potential 
editors to come to agreement about content in advance. 
This is also part of the good etiquette requested of all 
Wikipedia editors.
 
Once the groups upload their article, they are required 
to read and respond to any comments on its talk page
, 
and 
take any necessary action
. 
This involves making the 
appropriate changes or defending their decision of why 
they decided not to make the changes requested. Many of 
these comments come from other students in the class, as 
peer review is a required portion of the assignment. All 
students must make substantive comments on three
articles written by other groups. Those comments give the 
students substantial feedback on their work, which allows 
them to make their final product better. 
After the peer 
review has been posted on the articlesâÃÃ´ talk pages, the 
students have three weeks to act on those suggestions 
before the article is due in its final form. This takes them 
up to the final week of the semester.
",,Summative Assessment; Other,"wikipedia entry itself, peer assessment of performance, questions added to course evals (5).","STUDENT ASSESSMENT
When grading the assignment
, 
I take numerous factors into 
account, which are laid out to the students in the rubric 
listed on our course Wikipedia page. 
The students are 
required to grade others within their group based on the 
amount of effort they felt everyone gave
. 
These 
percentages of effort are emailed to me individually and 
are not communicated to the others in the group, but I do 
use them if there is rough consensus within the group to 
make small adjustments to individual final grades. The first 
time I used this assignment
, 
I was somewhat skeptical that 
students would be objective when assessing their own 
effort. In many instances, however, when two or three 
other students in a group have indicated that one individual 
did less than their fair share, I have found that the 
particular individual does agree. Some of the other criteria 
I use for assessment are:
ÃÃâ 
Wikipedia format for scientific articles is followed
ÃÃâ 
All images or graphics used have a Creative 
Commons license
ÃÃâ 
No primary literature was used for references, 
particularly for subjects with an established review 
literature history
.
ÃÃâ 
Proper grammar and punctuation 
 
In the past, I have asked the students to print out their 
articles and hand in the hard copies to provide me with a 
template for my written feedback and assessment. During 
the past semester I have used Scrible (www.scrible.com)
, 
a free web page annotation tool, to markup my studentsâÃÃ´ 
Wikipedia articles electronically. The software is HTML 5 
based, so there is no download necessary other than a 
bookmark that is loaded when the appropriate Wikipedia 
article to be assessed is on the screen
. 
After adding text 
or ink comments (an iPad version is also available) to the 
groupâÃÃ´s Wikipedia article, it can be saved to a personal 
library of annotated pages on the Scrible site. 
Those 
pages can then be emailed to the students so they can 
view my comments.
ACTIVITY ASSESSMENT
At the end of two out of the three semesters that I have run 
this assignment, I have asked the students to provide 
feedback during their end of semester course evaluations. 
In general, the students have positive feelings about the 
assignment (Table 2). The aggregated student responses 
indicated that the students agreed with the facts that this 
assignment improves their knowledge of neuroscience, it 
was a better learning experience compared to other types 
of science writing exercises they had in past courses, and 
it was an overall positive experience for them. 
The 
aggregated responses were neutral when indicating if this 
assignment improved their overall writing skills and if they 
were likely to continue to edit Wikipedia articles in the 
future.
 
In conclusion, student 
authoring 
of Wikipedia 
neuroscience articles by way of existing stub improvement 
is a writing intensive classroom activity that benefits the 
students, the worldwide community of Wikipedia users as 
well as the instructor. 
The students are typically more 
excited about this type of writing assignment since they 
know that their work may exist on the Internet for years to 
come and will be viewed by thousands of people from an 
interested audience. 
The global community benefits by 
gaining access to content created by knowledgeable and 
dedicated college students, who essentially become 
experts on their particular stub over the course of one 
semester. Finally, the instructor benefits by being assisted 
in student guidance and assessment by the student peer 
groups as well as outside Wikipedia editors during the 
course of the semester. While there is a relatively steep 
learning curve for both the students and the instructor, 
sufficient help resources exist for making this activity a 
positive experience for all involved.",,Yes,Located on an external website,"On ""course website"". ttp://en.wikipedia.org/

Overview 
This case was originally designed to be taught in person as 
an interrupted case. However, the entire case, or any parts 
therein, could be assigned as homework or completed 
during asynchronous or synchronous sessions in courses 
with remote components (e.g., Cook-Snyder and Ehlinger, 
in press). 
 
Below is a summary of each part of the case, and the 
learning objectives associated with each part. Skill/process 
objectives are identified with (S) and content objectives are 
identified with (C). 
Limited recommendations for 
implementation are included here; the reader is pointed to 
the full classroom implementation notes for details, including 
use in introductory and advanced courses and modifications 
based on course goals and available time. 
Part 1: ""The Simpsons Neuron"" 
âÃ³Ã¨ Summary: Students are introduced to a fictional 
neurosurgery patient, Miguel. Students then watch a 
brief video depicting the activity of MiguelâÃÃ´s neuron in real 
time, as Miguel watches brief video clips (e.g., Martin 
Luther KingâÃÃ´s ""I have a dreamâÃÂ¶"" speech). Students 
discover that the neuron fires strongly and specifically to 
clips of the animated TV show, The Simpsons (visible as 
the two peaks in firing rate depicted in Figure 1). 
âÃ³Ã¨ Objectives: 
o Engage in critical observation as the first step in the 
scientific process (S) 
o Describe various ways that a neuron might send 
information (C) 
Part 2: ""Just a fluke, or a reliable neural phenomenon?"" 
ÃÃâ 
Summary: Students work to interpret the quantitative 
data collected from MiguelâÃÃ´s neuron and compare this 
interpretation to their observations from the video in Part 
1. More details about the experimental design offer 
further insight into the neuronâÃÃ´s potential function and 
location. 
ÃÃâ Objectives: 
o Compare 
and 
contrast 
observational 
and 
quantitative data; interpret data presented in a 
figure (S) 
o To identify rationale for study design (C) 
Part 3: ""What is it about the Simpsons?"" 
ÃÃâ 
Summary: Students integrate the information that they 
have thus far to develop a hypothesis about the function 
of this individual neuronâÃÃ´s function (e.g., preferred 
stimuli, location in the brain) and its surrounding 
neuronal ensemble and design a simple study to test 
this hypothesis. 
ÃÃâ Note: Students should have a chance to share their 
thinking, so that they hear a variety of ways that the 
same data can be interpreted and hypotheses can be 
formulated. 
The instructor should not reveal any 
information about the function of MiguelâÃÃ´s neuron or 
highlight ""correct"" guesses, but simply acknowledge 
the variety of plausible responses (e.g., by listing on the 
board). However, the instructor may wish to identify 
broad categories in studentsâÃÃ´ responses (e.g., 
sensation/perception, motor, cognitive), as a way to 
connect to previous coursework and/or structure 
studentsâÃÃ´ thinking about different stimuli and brain 
processes involved in watching the video clips. This 
progressive disclosure is consistent with the 
pedagogical goals of interrupted cases (Herreid 2005). 
âÃ³Ã¨ Objectives: 
o Develop and revise testable hypotheses; design a 
simple experiment to test a hypothesis (S) 
o Describe how the firing rates of neurons can encode 
information (C) 
Part 4: ""Is there something funny about these data?"" 
ÃÃâ 
Summary: Students are presented with new quantitative 
data, assess whether their hypothesis from Part 3 is 
consistent with these data, and revise their hypothesis 
as needed. 
ÃÃâ Objectives: 
o 
Evaluate the extent to which hypotheses are 
consistent with new data; revise hypotheses; to 
interpret data presented in a figure (S) 
o Describe how the firing rates of neurons can 
encode information (C) 
Part 5: ""The researchers return"" 
ÃÃâ 
Summary: Students learn about a second phase of the 
experiment that Miguel is participating in, watch a brief 
video depicting MiguelâÃÃ´s neuronâÃÃ´s response during this 
new phase, and refine their hypothesis based on their 
observations. 
ÃÃâ Objectives: 
o Develop and revise testable hypotheses; evaluate 
the extent to which hypotheses are consistent with 
new data (S) 
o Describe how the firing rates of neurons can 
encode information (C) 
Part 6: ""Is that whatâÃÂ¶Miguel is thinking?"" 
ÃÃâ 
Summary: Students interpret the same data presented 
with higher temporal resolution and consider the 
rationale for the two phases of the experiment. 
ÃÃâ 
Note: Students will find that only one hypothesis âÃÃ¬ that 
this neuron is involved in some aspect of declarative 
memory âÃÃ¬ is consistent with the observational and 
quantitative data from this new phase of the experiment. 
It is helpful for the instructor to compare how studentsâÃÃ´ 
predictions and hypotheses have changed over time, by 
reviewing the student-generated ideas from Part 3. A 
conversation about consciousness and free will could 
also potentially emerge from this Part. 
ÃÃâ Objectives: 
o Compare 
and 
contrast 
observational 
and 
quantitative data; interpret data presented in a 
figure (S). 
o Describe how the firing rates of neurons can 
encode information (C) 
Part 7: ""A neuron for every memory?"" 
ÃÃâ 
Summary: Students learn that MiguelâÃÃ´s neuron is 
located in the hippocampal formation, sketch a diagram 
of how MiguelâÃÃ´s neuron might be integrated into a larger 
brain circuit, evaluate the evidence for and against a 
potential interpretation of these data (e.g., the 
""grandmother cell""), and design a study to assess 
similar phenomenon in a rodent model. 
ÃÃâ 
Notes: This part can be used in multiple ways. First, 
students can complete all questions in Part 7 in small 
groups, to allow them to discuss and idea-share. Each 
question in Part 7 could be assigned to different groups 
of students, and ideas shared via a jigsaw. Finally, it 
can be used as an assessment tool âÃÃ¬ either as 
homework, completed on the studentsâÃÃ´ own time, or as 
part of an exam (e.g., Cook-Snyder, 2017). 
ÃÃâ Objectives: 
o Describe 
how 
the 
hippocampal 
formation 
contributes to declarative memory; sketch a simple 
diagram of connections between the hippocampus 
and other areas of the brain; apply neuroscientific 
findings in humans to an experimental question in 
an animal model; critique a model of brain function 
that one neuron can encode a single, highly 
complex stimulus (C) 
ASSESSMENT
This case can be assessed in multiple ways. First, students 
could submit their completed case for a grade, using points 
or a holistic rubric (e.g., Meets expectations, In progress, or 
Not assessable). Collaboration with peers and revision of 
their answers is encouraged, so long as they can describe 
their thinking in their own words. StudentsâÃÃ´ engagement in 
class discussions and small-group work involving this case 
can also contribute toward their class participation (e.g., a 
guided self-assessment performed at midterm and end of ","Note that the start of assessment highlights group element, so I included it in the text excerpt",Formative assessment; Exam; Worksheet; Data (hand in a dataset and/or figure); Summative Assessment; Other,"reference a mid-term self-assessment  as well as menu of other options.  Note that they administer questionnaire about ""perceived and actual learning, self-reported ","ASSESSMENT

questions related to this case but not directly included in the 
case itself. A lower-order question might be, ""Identify a brain 
structure involved in memory recall."" A higher-order 
question might be, ""Describe how the firing rates of neurons 
can encode information. What is one way that this idea 
seems important and/or relevant to our understanding of 
how the brain and/or neurons function?"" 
Collecting feedback on this case.
Data on perceived and actual learning, self-reported 
confidence, enjoyment/engagement were collected from two 
neuroscience courses taught at small liberal arts colleges 
during Spring 2021. Both courses were fully remote with 
synchronous components. 
NEUR101 Introduction to 
Neuroscience was taught by T. Reppert at The University of 
the South, and consisted of 14 first-year, 9 sophomore and 
two senior students. The instructor used a traditional 
approach, in which students were assigned textbook 
readings prior to class (Bear et al., 2016) and material was 
clarified and extended during in-class lectures. NEU4100 
Neuroanatomy and Physiology was taught by Dr. Cook-
Snyder at Carthage College; it was a lecture and laboratory 
course containing 24 junior and senior neuroscience majors. 
The Simpsons Neuron case was the first case study used in 
the NEUR101 class but one of 14 cases used in NEU4100 
(Cook-Snyder, 2017). 
 
Students were encouraged to complete a brief, 
anonymous, online survey hosted by Qualtrics before 
beginning the case and after the case was completed. 
 Qualitative data are presented below. Quantitative data 
are presented for each course, along with case 
modifications and implementation notes specific to each 
course. When possible, pre- and post-case data were 
paired, by matching random code-words provided by the 
students on each survey, and two-tailed repeated-measures 
t-tests were performed. Data associated with non-unique 
code words (i.e., a word used by more than one student) 
were omitted from analysis. Due to omissions in code 
words, mostly on the post-case survey (e.g., if students 
forgot their code word), only a subset of data from each 
class could be analyzed in this way (NEUR101, n=6; 
NEU4100, n=18). 
Student Enjoyment and Engagement 
Active learning techniques, such as the use of case studies, 
have been shown to enhance student learning (e.g., 
Michael, 2006; Haak et al., 2011; Freeman et al., 2014; 
Deslauriers et al., 2019), promote persistence in the 
sciences (Braxton et al., 2008; Graham et all, 2011), reduce 
achievement 
gaps 
amongst 
students 
historically 
underrepresented in the sciences (e.g., Haak et al., 2011), 
and contribute to positive learning experiences and 
studentsâÃÃ´ attitudes (Armbruster et al., 2009; Lo, 2010; 
Deslauriers et al., 2019). 
Importantly, students may 
perceive their own learning be lower in active settings than 
in passive environments (Deslauriers et al., 2019) and their 
""buy-in may contribute to their engagement with and benefit 
from"" active learning approaches (Cavanagh et al., 2016). 
In this way, case studies may have a unique advantage. 
Case studies are often designed to have real-world 
implications and enable students to assume an active role 
in solving a relevant scientific problem with peers. It is 
plausible that case enjoyment and engagement may 
contribute to studentsâÃÃ´ sense of science identity and/or 
efficacy, and thus enhance persistence. While the question 
of whether case studies contribute to persistence in the 
sciences was beyond the scope of this study, we felt it was 
important to assess studentsâÃÃ´ enjoyment of and investment 
in the Simpsons Neuron case.
 
StudentsâÃÃ´ enjoyment and investment were assessed 
using a Likert-type scale (1 - strongly disagree; 5 - strongly 
agree); a one-sample t-test was used to compare scores to 
a neutral score of 3. Overall, students reported that they 
enjoyed working on this case [introductory: M=4.86 out of 5, 
SD=0.10; t(13)=19.14, p<0.01; advanced: M=4.15 out of 5, 
SD=1.14; t(19)=4.52, p<0.01] and felt invested in working on 
this case [introductory: M=4.64 out of 5, SD=0.49; 
t(13)=16.13, p<0.01; advanced: M=3.95 out of 5, SD=1.15; 
t(19)=5.66, p<0.01]. 
 When asked what was most memorable, interesting, or 
engaging about this case, studentsâÃÃ´ open-ended responses 
generally fell into one of three categories: 
1. Working with authentic data: 
âÃ³Ã¨ It was very cool to see actual data from the study 
âÃ³Ã¨ I thought the videos were really cool to see how a 
neuron in an actual case responded to this situation 
âÃ³Ã¨ I found the original audio of the neuron and its 
correlation to the stimuli presented to the patient to 
be most fascinating 
âÃ³Ã¨ I really liked being able to actually hear the little 
beeps that indicated the action potential firing. 
âÃ³Ã¨ I liked how there were videos regarding the patient. 
This made it more interesting to complete the case 
study and it also made it feel like we were working 
with an actual patient. 
2. The nature of the Simpsons stimulus: 
âÃ³Ã¨ I like how the experiment involved lots of different TV 
shows/movies that we could use to draw 
comparisons to the Simpson's [sic]. 
âÃ³Ã¨ I found the fact that the Simpsons was involved pretty 
funny. 
âÃ³Ã¨ It was interesting because we can relate to the idea 
of a TV show like the Simpsons. 
âÃ³Ã¨ I'd like to know if the Simpson's [sic] was the patientâÃÃ´s 
favorite show or just a show they occasionally 
watched. 
âÃ³Ã¨ Being able to see the different ways Miguel's neurons 
fire during the Simpsons and other videos compared 
to each other. 
3. Neuronal coding: 
ÃÃâ Thinking about how a neuron is so specialized and 
there are so many in the human brain that they can 
be diverse and specialized in what signals they send. 
ÃÃâ It's interesting to see how neurons can encode such 
specific things like this. 
The fictional details about Miguel also clearly impacted 
some studentsâÃÃ´ engagement. For instance, ""I just enjoyed 
seeing [Miguel] react to the Simpson's episode and not to 
wall street [sic], even though he is an economics major."" 
Assessment of Learning Objectives 
Data related to specific learning objectives were collected, 
assessing the impact that this case had on studentsâÃÃ´ 
confidence across a range of scientific skills. One case is 
not expected to impact studentâÃÃ´s confidence dramatically, 
and longer impacts were not assessed. 
ÃÃâ Objective: Describe how the firing rates of neurons can 
encode information (Parts 3-6) 
Assessment: Students were asked the following 
question: ""In 1-2 sentences and using your own words, 
briefly describe how the firing rates of neurons can 
encode information."" The majority of students (63.8% of 
NEU4100 and 50% of NEUR101) provided an accurate 
answer referencing changes to the frequency of action 
potentials based on stimulus features. 
Example 
responses included: 
o Neurons encode information in sets of spikes that 
have temporal patterns. (NEU4100) 
o The firing rates of neurons encode information in 
response to stimuli which can either evoke an 
increase or decrease in firing rate. This may indicate 
what these neurons are responsive to and what does 
not [sic]. (NEU4100) 
o Neuron firing rates are altered by previous encoding 
of information and can fire at higher rates when 
preferred or familiar stimuli are presented. 
(NEU4100) 
o Neurons fire action potentials, electrical impulses, 
and the sequence, strength, rapidity, and endurance 
of neuronal firing can determine what information is 
processed and received. (NEUR101) 
The remaining students provided answers that were 
either partially correct or referenced related content from 
the unit/course: 
ÃÃâ When we experience an emotion, we create an 
LTP for the stimulus. When we remember that 
stimulus, the same neurons fire, strengthening 
the LTP. (NEU4100) 
Students also reported that the case was a valuable way 
to learn about how the brain encodes abstract 
concepts/stimuli 
[introductory: M=4.64, 
SD=0.50; 
t(13)=12.36, p<0.01; advanced: M=4.25, SD=0.91; 
t(19)=6.14, p<0.01]. 
ÃÃâ Objectives: Develop and revise testable hypotheses 
(Parts 3 and 4); design a simple experiment to test a 
hypothesis (Part 3); evaluate the extent to which 
hypotheses are consistent with new data (Parts 4 and 5) 
Assessment: Students reported that the case was a 
valuable way to learn about the scientific process 
[introductory: M=4.67, SD=0.49; t(14)=13.23, p<0.01; 
advanced: M=4.20, SD=0.83; t(19)=6.44, p<0.01]. 
Students also reported increased confidence in their 
ability to ask good scientific questions [introductory: 
t(5)=-7.00, p<0.01; advanced: t(17)=-2.36, p<0.05; see 
Table 1]. No differences were found in studentsâÃÃ´ reported 
confidence in revising hypotheses, continuing to ask 
questions, formulating their own conclusions, and 
considering alternative interpretations of data. There 
was a trend toward an improvement in confidence in 
thinking creatively about scientific problems in both 
courses [introductory: t(5)=-2.45, p=0.06; advanced: 
t(17)=-2.05, p=0.06]. 
ÃÃâ Objectives: Compare and contrast observational and 
quantitative data (Parts 2 and 6) 
Assessment: Students reported that the case helped 
them to think critically about different types of data 
[introductory: M=4.71, SD=0.47; t(13)=13.68, p<0.01; 
advanced: M=4.25, SD=0.64; t(19)=8.75, p<0.01]. 
Introductory students also reported increased confidence 
in their ability to identify ways that observational and 
qualitative data can differ [t(5)=-3.87, p<0.05]. 
ÃÃâ Objectives: Interpret data presented in a figure (Parts 5 
and 6). 
Assessment: Advanced students reported increased 
confidence in their ability to identify different parts of a 
figure [t(17)=-1.85, p=0.08]. 
Self-Reported Competence and Understanding 
The Simpsons Neuron case is written with a second-person 
point of view, so that the student assumes the role of a 
character âÃÃ¬ a science student âÃÃ¬ in the narrative. We were 
curious if studentsâÃÃ´ self-efficacy, or perceived ability to be 
successful in science, was impacted by this case. 
 
StudentsâÃÃ´ science competence and understanding were 
assessed using a Likert-type scale (1 - strongly disagree; 7 
- strongly agree). 
Unfortunately, repeated-measures 
statistics were not informative, due to small sample size 
resulting from few matching code words (see above). 
Amongst introductory (NEUR101) students, trends in the 
data suggest that studentsâÃÃ´ self-reported competence and 
understanding either stayed similar or improved slightly after 
this case (Figure 3), though the data are too limited to 
generalize further. It is also important to note that self-
assessment skills were probably less developed in these 
introductory students than the advanced students taking 
NEU4100. 
 Amongst advanced (NEU4300) students, there were few 
differences between pre- and post-case responses (Figure 
4). The relatively high pre-case responses may reflect these 
studentsâÃÃ´ overall sense of competence consistent with their 
academic experience. The variability in some of the 
advanced studentsâÃÃ´ responses (e.g., ""I could see myself 
potentially pursuing a career in research"") may also reflect 
studentsâÃÃ´ knowledge about their post-collegiate path in their 
sciences, especially with >60% of students reporting 
clinically-focused health care career goals.

brief oral presentation on anatomical function to the 
whole class, earning half of the dissection grade. 
Presentations are followed by the same groups

Students evaluate hypotheses from the digestive 
system as a class, and then choose from a variety of 
hypotheses about the cardiovascular system. The 
whole class first evaluates relative intestinal length 
by using student generated data and information on 
feeding ecology. Vertebrate intestine length varies 
greatly according to diet type, ranging from of 3-6 
times the body length in carnivores to over ten times 
the body length in herbivores (Kardong, 2008). 
Students and the instructor use graphing to evaluate 
differences among mean relative intestinal lengths. 
Hypothesis writing and evaluation is usually helped 
by the few students already familiar with the 
relationship between diet and gut length. Less

Structure and function of ecosystems are linked. Specifically, large trees as structures in riparian ecosystems support river ecosystem function by shading rivers to cool water temperatures, and providing a source of large woody debris to create complex riverine habitat.
Human activities can impair ecosystem function. In this project, human impacts on riparian vegetation are analyzed both quantitatively and qualitatively. Impaired riparian ecosystems are linked with impaired riverine ecosystems through group discussion in the field and student research following the field trip.
With respect to detailed learning outcomes upon completion of this activity, students will be able to:
Discern riparian from upland ecosystems.
Locate local rivers and riparian ecosystems.
Measure ecosystem attributes using ecological field equipment.
Identify native tree and shrub species, as well as common invasive plant species.
Collect and analyze ecological data.
Assess human impacts on riparian ecosystem structure and function.
Research state laws regulating activities in riparian ecosystems and assess their effectiveness.",,"Lectures include background on riparian ecology, human use of riparian areas, and laws regulating those activities.

Data will be collected at two or more sites, including: trees by species, diameter, density and maximum height; shrub density; canopy cover; understory light levels; percentage of cover of natives versus. Invasive species, temperature and relative humidity.
Qualitative assessments are made at all sites of vegetation and land use by humans.
Data collected in the field are ideally shared in the field so that students can take home the summary data to write their reports. Alternatively, data may be posted on a web site for later access.

During the activity, student learning can be informally assessed during the field trip in several ways. The instructor should observe data collection to validate that methods are followed appropriately, and that species are identified properly.

Our course consists of four modules over a 4
-5 week 
period
. 
The first week students practice sterile technique 
and plate rat cortical neurons in multi-well chambers
. 
At 
the same time students are reading and discussing 
scientific papers that demonstrate how culture techniques 
are used to explore cellular function (for example, Vitrio 
and Zheng
, 
2012; Munnamalai and Suter
,

The next 
two modules use immunocytochemistry and neurotoxicity 
studies
. 
Here students visualize the neuronal cytoskeleton 
using antibodies and explore how free radicals degrade the 
cytoskeleton and lipid membrane
. 
The goal is to introduce 
two simple techniques that students can build upon as they 
design their own experiments in the final module.
 
In our experience, students are able to master these 
techniques with ease
. 
Additionally, these techniques 
generally do not take the full lab period, leaving time for 
discussing scientific papers and planning the next module
. 
Because they are modular, instructors may choose to 
eliminate or substitute one of the module 2 or 3 techniques 
to make more time for student-generated experiments 
(module 4).
 
The logistics of the four-week cell culture unit can be 
complicated
. 
Typically students begin formulating ideas 
two weeks prior to module 4
. 
They conduct literature 
searches and propose their research idea in a short 3-5 
page ""grant"" proposal, which details the hypothesis and 
predictions, provides a list of materials, and describes how 
the data will be analyzed (i.e.
, 
what statistical tests or other 
measurements will be used)

ability to perform matrix multiplication and interpret the meanings of individual 
transition probabilities that you point out. Use this to determine whether you 
need to do more to explain matrix algebra and the concepts of matrix population

Also, use suggested pre-lab questions about designing the lab activities. 
During Week 1 Field Work: Ask student groups individually questions about 
their numbering scheme and how they think the stages should be classified. Do 
they understand why they are putting tags on the plants? 
Homework: Have the students entered the data correctly? 
During Week 2 Computer Lab: Circulate through classroom and ask each pair 
of students questions about their progress. Have they ever used this type of 
software? Does it make sense whatâÃÃ´s happening from a software standpoint? 
How many iterations are they running? What transitions did they modify, and 
what did that mean? Point to a particular line on their screen and ask what it 
means. If many groups are missing these basic questions, consider drawing

Our lesson bridges the gap between student understanding of content knowledge and their ability to connect this knowledge to larger biological principles through the integration of PSL and the 5 Core Concepts of Biology (5CCs) identified in the Vision and Change report.

to define as a monophyletic group.

Learning Objectives
Following this lesson, students will be able to:
âÃÂ¢ LO-1: Compare and contrast unknown organisms and decide if they 
are algae.
âÃÂ¢ LO-2: Summarize the general characteristics of algae and explain, 
with an example, how exceptions exist for each characteristic.
âÃÂ¢ LO-3: Construct and interpret a Eukaryotic Tree of Life in order to 
recognize the relationships among and independent evolutionary 
origins of eukaryotic algae.",,"""The lesson relies heavily on group work and a worksheet, 
two in-class active-learning techniques shown to improve 
learning gains at the undergraduate level (27). Whole class 
discussions, clicker questions and real-time drawing (instructor 
draws using document camera, students copy and annotate) are 
also used to encourage student participation. The worksheet is 
structured so that students work in groups on a prompt (e.g., a 
sorting task, drawing a phylogenetic tree), followed by a whole 
class discussion where groups report out their responses in 
order to create a consensus answer. During class discussions, 
the instructor encourages students to respond to each otherâÃÃ´s 
comments in order to include many voices in the conversation. 
During real-time drawing of the consensus phylogenetic tree by 
the instructor, students are encouraged to add or edit suggestions 
for how to sort the organisms into clades. The instructor draws 
the phylogenetic tree in the bracket style known for being easier 
for students to interpret correctly (28).""",,Formative assessment; Exam; Worksheet; Summative Assessment,,"""The lesson uses a combination of formative feedback in-class 
and summative feedback on a midterm exam and final exam. In-
class, students receive formative feedback from their peers both 
in their groups and as a whole class when they discuss how to 
sort the algae cards, craft their list of general algal characteristics 
and build their phylogenetic trees. During group work, the 
instructor and TAs circulate to provide additional formative 
feedback. Clicker questions also provide formative feedback 
during periods of whole-class discussion. Clicker questions are 
provided in Supporting File S4. Got Algae âÃÃ¬ presentation slides

This experiment contains considerable hands-on work, where students interface 
with web-based citizen science portals and computer programming tools. Given 
these exposures to novel resources, there are several opportunities for 
evaluating progress. In-class work includes the development of information 
literacy skills, when students are tasked with finding information about butterfly 
species and respective host plant species, as well as how to extract data from 
citizen science programs. When students get to the point of making changes to R 
code and attempting to run analyses, there will inevitably be problems. Most 
issues will arise due to typos; seeing error messages during class time provides 
an assessment of studentsâÃÃ´ understanding of the importance of relevant syntax 
such as case sensitivity and quoting strings in R. Such in-class assessments rely 
on instructorsâÃÃ´ attentiveness and availability during exercises; examples and 
troubleshooting for common mistakes are provided in supplementary materials 
and on the GitHub repository. In addition to the hands-on work, the Questions 
for Further Thought and Discussion section provides additional material for

âÃÂ¢ Explain the difference between deoxyribonucleotides (dNTPs)
and dideoxyribonucleotides (ddNTPs), and explain why it is
that ddNTPs terminate DNA synthesis reactions.
âÃÂ¢ Use an M&M model to apply knowledge of the structure and
function of ddNTPs to predict and analyze the products result-
ing from Sanger dideoxy sequencing reactions.
âÃÂ¢ Interpret an electropherogram that is obtained from a DNA
sequencing facility as a result of Sanger/dideoxy sequencing.
âÃÂ¢ Apply concepts of dNTP structure and function to explain DNA
replication and DNA polymer extension.",,"The technique in this exercise involves using M&MâÃÃ´s
to construct Sanger sequencing products. First, the instructor draws a
representation of the non-template DNA strand and the template
DNA strand on the board (Figure 1A) and then walks the class
through constructing two-sample sequencing fragments. It should
be made clear to the students that even though the sequence is repre-
sented on the board, we pretend not to know it, and the task is to use
Sanger sequencing to figure it out. The primer from the worksheet is drawn next to the non-template strand. The students should observe
that the primer matches up to a specific location on the template
strand. The primer attaches, and then the extension of the new
DNA strand is shown, with the 5âÃâ¤ and 3âÃâ¤ ends of the strands labeled
for reference. The instructor then shows how incorporation of a
ddNTP stops synthesis of the growing strand.
With the technique now modeled by the instructor, the students
are asked to transfer the two-dimensional model on the board to
their M&MâÃÃ´s. Each student team is asked to make the complete set
of possible fragments given their ddNTP (ddATP, ddCTP, ddGTP,
or ddTTP).
Observations. As students arrange their M&MâÃÃ´s, they will
observe the many fragments they form from the candy. Each group
will have fragments of different lengths based on which ddNTP team
they are on. It is important for students to observe that the fragments
contain the same sequence of DNA but are different lengths. These
different lengths are caused by the ddNTPs (peanut M&MâÃÃ´s), which
terminate the fragment extension (Figure 2). The teams should
observe that they do not have a complete Sanger sequence because
they have been using only one type of ddNTP.
Patterns. The first pattern students should notice is that whenever
a ddNTP is added, the strand stops extending. Students will count
the fragments as well as the length of each fragment and record them
(Figure 1B). On the board will be a blank electrophoresis gel drawing
with four wells labeled A, C, G, and T to represent the different types of
ddNTP. Each group will mark their sequencing fragments on the gel as
if they carried out agarose gel electrophoresis (Figure 1C). With the
class data compiled on the board, the students will see that the longer
sequencing fragments are marked closer to the wells than shorter frag-
ments. They will also see the pattern that no two dashes (sequencing
fragments) line up with each other on the gel. It is important that the
students recognize that each group took the same DNA template
strand and primer but used a unique ddNTP; together the teams devel-
oped a model of the complete set of Sanger sequencing products. The
students should now be able to read the dashes from the bottom to the
top of the ""gel"" and determine the sequence of the non-template
strand. This reading provides the DNA sequence of the non-template
strand they saw at the start of the lesson in a 5âÃâ¤ âÃÃ­ 3âÃâ¤ direction.
Explanations. Having done the M&M activity and investigated
how the structures of dNTPs differ from ddNTPs, students will be able to explain why ddNTPs are needed for Sanger sequencing.
Students will show their understanding of ddNTPs and Sanger
Sequencing through a series of hypothetical questions. These
questions are provided for each team in the DNA Sequencing

in class or individually as homework.",,Worksheet; Data (hand in a dataset and/or figure); Other,photo of 'dna sequencing reaction' visual,"Each student team photographs their set of DNA sequencing reaction

knowledge of how this difference in structure affects DNA synthesis
and, ultimately, leads to the ability to sequence DNA. The worksheet
asks the students some basic questions about the Sanger sequencing
technique and then asks them to apply this knowledge to determine
the base sequence of a DNA fragment by using a picture of an autora-

classroom, it can more seamlessly become part of the educational 
experience for all students. Furthermore, participating in a CURE 
has significant impacts on studentsâÃÃ´ sense of self-efficacy as a scientist and may promote retention in science, particularly 
for students from under-represented groups (34). One strength

example, Sepel et. al. (23) found that students who used replicas

internet for more information about the history of microscopy. 
Even digitized primary materials allow students to read the

collaborative discourse, which improves the depth of student 
thinking and scientific understanding (19). Students work in

complete worksheet questions. Working together encourages 
discussion and sharing of opinions about the material. We

begun to develop around a set of desirable features for 
courses in undergraduate neuroscience curricula (e.g., 
Ramirez, 1997; Wiertelak, 2003). Our courses should both 
capture and generate interest in neuroscience and should 
promote understanding of scientific inquiry as a way of 
learning about the world. They should emphasize 
investigatory, inquiry-based exercises that allow students 
to test their conceptual knowledge and to develop skills in 
problem solving, reasoning, and arguing from evidence. 
Our courses should encourage students to consider the 
interdisciplinary nature of neuroscience and should 
encourage integrative thought that transcends traditional 
disciplinary boundaries. They should promote data fluency 
and the development of computational skills necessary for 
working with increasingly complex concepts and patterns 
of data. In addition, our courses should broaden exposure 
to research methodologies and should link those 
methodologies to solving real problems in both basic and 
applied contexts. 
An effective means of reaching many of these 
objectives is to structure learning experiences around 
interesting problems in our own research.

[FROM CONCLUSIONS]
Such exercises can be used to meet a variety of 
pedagogical objectives, including fostering interest in 
scientific inquiry, promoting integrative thought across 
traditional disciplinary boundaries, and enhancing data 
fluency. The use of single-unit data can expose students 
to methods of inquiry and a world of knowledge not 
traditionally tapped in undergraduate laboratory courses, 
and knowledge and skills gained by students can enrich 
their perspectives of the functioning brain. Given the 
remarkable extent to which single-unit data has increased 
our understanding of neural processes to date, we believe 
students will appreciate, and be excited by, this opportunity 
to learn about this important approach, in particular, and 
neural processing, in general. 

","Note that they are broader, but mentioned at start and end","During the first lab meeting, students were informed that 
they would be given raw electrophysiological data recorded 
from non-human primates performing a spatial working 
memory task and that they would be asked to evaluate an 
idea about the role of a particular class of receptors in 
modulating the activity of neurons engaged in the task. 
Prior to being given any further details, however, students 
engaged two hour-long laboratory-based exercises aimed 
at developing competence basic single-unit data analytic 
procedures. 
The first exercise required students to perform spike 
separation techniques using OFS. This software is fully 
functional with sample data supplied by the vendor and can 
be freely downloaded from the vendorâÃÃ´s website 
(http://www.plexoninc.com). Instructions on how to use 
this software can be found on the companion website. 
OFS supports a number of spike separation techniques, 
including manual cluster-cutting in two- or (visually 
captivating) three-dimensional feature space, waveform-
crossing, and several automated algorithms. Students 
were provided with the sample data file and were asked to 
use spike-sorting techniques (1) to determine the number 
of neurons recorded in the data file and (2) to estimate the 
number of spikes per neuron. The exercise required 
students to evaluate features of spike waveforms, to learn 
about data file structures, and to become familiar with and 
use raster and histogram displays. Students were 
encouraged to use several sorting methods, and in order to 
promote discussion on the effectiveness of each method, 
students worked in groups of two or three and used the 
same data file. 
The second exercise, conducted one week later, 
required students to determine whether the neurons in the 
data file exhibited an alteration in firing rate in relation to a 
repeated behavioral event. In order to evaluate this idea, 
students generated standard 
peri-event firing rate 
histograms using NEX. As with OFS, NEX is fully 
functional with sample data, and both software and data 
can be freely downloaded from the vendorâÃÃ´s website 
(http://www.neuroexplorer.com). When students were 
comfortable using the software and had successfully 
generated several peri-event histograms, they were asked 
to generate cross-correlation histograms to examine the 
incidence of synchronous firing between simultaneously 
recorded pairs of neurons. Both peri-event and cross-
correlation techniques have been used widely in the 
behavioral neurophysiology literature, and both are 
described in detail on the companion website (see Perkel, 
et al., 1967a,b, for more thorough consideration of these 
techniques). 
Importantly, during the weekly lab meetings, students 
evaluated background literature related to the role of 
prefrontal cortex in performance of the behavioral task 
through student-lead discussion of several relevant articles 
(Funahashi et al., 1989; Constantinidis et al., 2001; Wang 
et al., 2004). Thus, in addition to acquiring skills in 
analyzing single-unit data, students developed an 
understanding of the experimental context in which the 
techniques have been applied. 
2
Following the second laboratory meeting, students 
were given access to the four primate data files and were 
asked to use them to evaluate the following proposal: 
Cholinergic muscarinic mechanisms play a role in 
maintaining information in spatial working memory. 
Students were told that methoctramine (a relatively 
selective M-like muscarinic receptor antagonist), had been 
iontophoretically applied mid-way through recording 
sessions in which the task had been performed. (Students 
were informed that the actual drug applied was not a 
muscarinic antagonist; the drug was not revealed for 
proprietary reasons.) Several relevant resources were 
made available to students, including a review of 
muscarinic receptor-mediated signaling mechanisms 
(Cualfield & Birdsall, 1998). Students were given two 
weeks to analyze the data and to prepare a lab report 
detailing their findings and conclusions. 
",,Paper / report / problem set; Data (hand in a dataset and/or figure),,"Students submitted comprehensive reports that required 
them both to master practical lab skills in working with unit 
data and to consider their analyses within the context of 
published research. The quality of student projects was 
quite high. All students were able to sort waveforms 
successfully and to generate firing rate histograms that 
showed the neuronal activity patterns of their cells. 
Following the two practice labs, all students could explain 
how to use OFS and NEX to work with the sample data, 
and all could produce accurate firing rate rasters and 
histograms from raw, unsorted data (Figure 2). Students 
reported that having an opportunity to practice using 
software with sample data files before being given actual 
data was useful. 
Although students were able to conduct isolated 
analyses quite easily, most encountered difficulty in 
interpreting their results and in preparing their reports. 
There were two characteristic problems. First, most 
students generated relatively weak hypotheses. Signaling 
mechanisms of muscarinic receptors had not been 
explicitly discussed in class, and students mentioned that it 
would have been useful to generate a list of relevant 
questions and testable hypotheses as a group before 
considering the data. In fact, with any unit data, a range of 
questions could be asked âÃÃ¬ some more easily addressed

the file?"", ""How many appear to fire in relation to a 
measured behavioral response?"") and to ask more 
complicated questions after these initial questions have 
been answered. 
Second, although all students knew how to conduct the 
appropriate analyses, a number failed to present their 
analyses in a concise, organized and appropriate fashion. 
For example, one report included several pages of graphs 
and tables for each cell in the sample. Another report 
included only a raster display for a single cell during a 
single trial. Although most reports were organized well, 
more time could have been spent during lab meetings 
discussing how to select and present appropriate analyses 
that support drawn conclusions. In future iterations of this 
exercise, students will be encouraged to consider more 
carefully the rationale for the selection of particular analytic 
tools and figures in published background readings.

experiments in small groups likely garner many additional 
benefits for students than do courses in which students work

work done in groups enhances learning (44-47) and benefits 
from diverse contributing perspectives (48-50). In particular, 
an examination of collegiate student group work demonstrated 
that racio-ethnic diversity was positively related to group 
efficacy (51).
Additionally, educational research has shown that applied

increase 
interest

traditionally underrepresented populations in the sciences 
by demonstrating the relevance of the course material (11). 
In particular, including content related to social justice issues

engagement and persistence (52), which may be one of the 
many reasons the AAAS encourages courses to connect 
science to society more directly (12). This lesson has very 
overt relevance and highlights the importance of considering 
developmental biology in discussions about environmental 
issues when students observe the impact of pesticide exposure 
on organogenesis (followed by more focused and personally-
relevant experiments in the Independent Experiment portion). 
It also has the opportunity to be connected to issues of social 
justice around access to quality water and the link between this

value of a course project and demonstrates how coursework 
can be connected to broader issues students may care about. 
In fact, CUREs are recommended as a mechanism for making 
scientific research more inclusive because they grant access to 
meaningful research experiences for all students (16). While 
some particularly recommend establishing CURE programs at 
minority serving institutions (54), establishing CUREs at any

introduce students to the planetary boundaries concept and to 
have students complete the first assignment (Table 2",Yes,"Students who complete this lesson explicitly hold different 
perceptions of how human activity has changed various earth

alter these processes without crossing biophysical thresholds. 
Such perceptions would be difficult to draw out particularly 
in a large-enrollment course without purposeful opportunities 
to promote studentsâÃÃ´ sense of belonging and self-efficacy 
(14,15). In this lesson, these perceptions are illustrated in the

boundary and the degree to which othersâÃÃ´ perceptions and their 
own align with our current scientific understanding.
The class sessions in which this lesson takes place, are 
designed to promote participation of all students in several 
ways. First, a student response system (Kahoot!) was used to ask 
where students placed the safe operating space for humanity 
prior to reading the paper (Supporting File S2. Perceptions and 
Cooperative Learning âÃÃ¬ Reading Assurance Assignment and 
In-Class Polling Questions). Students answered this question 
using personal accounts that were established at the beginning 
of the semester to facilitate in-class participation during all 
class sessions. Responses are then made visible to the entire 
class and used to frame instructions for the in-class group 
assignment. This question is used to give instructors a sense of 
the variability in responses that students will be discussing and 
serves as a transition between a short introductory lecture and the 
collaborative group activity. The instructor and teaching assistants 
circulate among the groups to ensure that discussion time is 
equally shared. Timing prompts can also be given to ensure each 
member of the group has an equal time to share their predictions 
prior to compiling group results and discussing the paper. In 
addition, we recommend that the instructor require each group 
to appoint a student to be a discussion moderator to ensure 
equal participation of all group members; this is particularly 
critical in large-enrollment courses in which instructor access 
to each group is limited by seat arrangement. To complete 
guided discussion questions (Supporting File S5. Perceptions and 
Cooperative Learning âÃÃ¬ Discussion and Assessment Questions), 
we suggest first having students perform a Think-Pair-Share and 
then reconvene as a 4-member group to develop answers to 
each question. The instructor can then call on groups randomly 
and/or call on specific groups that arrive at particular answers 
to each question for the full class discussion. Having students 
complete both formative assessments through use of the guided 
discussion questions and summative assessments (Supporting

The companion information website contained the embedded videos, botanical drawings, photographs, and general information for each species. The online, dynamic practice-quizzing system allowed students to select which species they wanted to be quizzed on. Questions about those plants were then dynamically generated following several question templates, enabling students to take many practice quizzes with few or no repeated questions. Students were surveyed to gain insight into usage patterns and opinions of these resources. Student feedback was positive, and all three resources were heavily used.

Learning Objectives
The lesson plan contains both NOS and content learning objectives.
During the first class one of our main objectives, an NOS concept
included in the NGSS, is for students to be able to identify that 
""
Science
is a human endeavor
"" 
(NGSS Lead States, 2013, App. H). More explicit
extensions under this category are that men and women from different
social, cultural, and ethnic backgrounds work as scientists and engi-
neers; science and engineering are influenced by society, and society
is influenced by science and engineering (NGSS Lead States, 2013,
App. H, p. 6). Engaging students by sharing a story based on a more
accurate representation of the history of research on the structure of
DNA, puts them in a position to appreciate the difficulties women sci-
entists experienced in the socio-cultural environment that existed in
England during the early 1950s. A follow-up class discussion prompts
students to consider the role of gender bias in science with reference
to Rosalind Franklin
âÃÃ´
s experiences, and to reflect upon the extent to
which gender bias might inhibit the process of science. Arguments
about her contribution and the role of gender help students under-
stand the influence of society and culture on science.
The lesson plan also has several other learning objectives with ref-
erence to the Next Generation Science Standards. The specific cross-
cutting concepts, science and engineering practices, and life-sciences
core idea met by this lesson plan are listed in Table 1 (NGSS Lead
States, 2013, App. E, F, & G). For instance, one of the crosscutting
concepts is the relationship between the structure of a molecule and its function. During the second day of the class, students are asked to
explain the semi-conservative mode of DNA replication with reference
to their understanding of DNA structure and, in particular, the fact
that it exists as a double helix. Each strand of the original molecule
serves as a template for a new complementary strand, thus ensuring
faithful replication of the DNA molecule.

and instructors encourage all students to act out the part of 
enzymes. In addition, using familiar objects (plastic building 
bricks) as the substrates and a human action in place of the 
enzyme may make the concept of enzyme kinetics more 
relatable and approachable. This simulation is performed 
in small groups, where students can play several roles in conducting the simulation (including timekeeper, data recorder, 
student ""enzyme"", or observer). Therefore, this activity could 
be modified to allow differently-abled students to participate 
depending on their needs by having the instructor and/or student 
group members discuss how all students can be involved prior 
to beginning the simulation. For example, in one of our classes, 
we had a visually impaired student who enjoyed being the 
""enzyme"" because this kinesthetic activity doesnâÃÃ´t require seeing 
the bricks.
This activity also provides multiple ways for students to answer 
questions about the material. When students complete the 
activity, they first answer questions in writing independently 
or in small groups, and then questions are discussed orally as 
a larger group. This technique allows all students to have the 
opportunity to participate. Structured discussion of individual 
student responses to the post-activity conceptual questions also 
allows students to teach each other.",,,Yes,,Yes,,"

âÃÂ¢ ""How do enzymes catalyze biological reactions?""
âÃÂ¢ ""How is the biological activity of macromolecules regulated?""

âÃÂ¢ Formulating hypotheses
Learning Objectives
Students will be able to:
âÃÂ¢ Describe the effect of increasing substrate concentration on the 
velocity of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction.
âÃÂ¢ Define and estimate the maximum velocity of the reaction (Vmax) and 
the Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) for a given enzyme.
âÃÂ¢ Predict the effect of a noncompetitive inhibitor and a competitive 
inhibitor on the Vmax and the Km for a given enzyme.",,"In this lesson, students use a hands-on model for enzyme 
kinetics as well as collecting and graphing their own data. This 
strategy encourages students to work together to simulate an 
enzyme-catalyzed reaction, analyze the data, and compare what 
they observe to what they have learned about the function and 
structure of real enzymes. Cooperative, constructivist-based 
activities that are open ended, require interpretation, and have 
answers that are not directly found in a textbook were proposed 
as strategies that are effective to help students build knowledge 
in biology (19). Moreover, active learning using physical models 
of a biological concept has been shown to improve student 
scores on questions that test those concepts to a greater degree 
than concepts where other types of active learning, such as
group problem solving or clicker questions, are used (9). These 
types of activities can be included in Process-Oriented Guided 
Inquiry Learning (POGIL), in which small groups of students use 
active learning activities led by students and facilitated by the 
instructor to develop their own understanding, explore models, 
use discipline-specific knowledge, and develop important skills 
(20).",,Exam; Paper / report / problem set; Data (hand in a dataset and/or figure); Other,pre/post,"Students in our course have multiple opportunities to 
demonstrate their understanding of enzyme kinetics and 
inhibition. During the activity, students are prompted to answer 
questions on the activity worksheet and discuss answers with 
their lab partners. At the end of the activity, students complete 
wrap-up questions, which are discussed as a class. Prior to the 
next week, students answer pre-lab discussion questions focused 
on the concepts introduced in the lesson. In our course, after 
completing this activity students conduct an experiment using 
beta-galactosidase that they have purified from E. coli to catalyze 
the hydrolysis of a substrate in the presence and absence of 
a potential inhibitor. Laboratory assignments ask students to 
examine and graph the data and use these measurements to 
discuss whether a particular chemical is an inhibitor, and if so, 
what type. We also assess student learning of these concepts 
on summative exams and problem sets in the lecture portion 
of the course.
In designing the Breaking Bricks activity and its corresponding 
assessments, we focused on addressing two core concepts from 
Vision and Change (2). First, our activity and corresponding 
laboratory experiments expose students to the idea that protein 
structure defines its function. Second, we connect the biological 
process of enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis into a larger framework 
of chemical transformation pathways that are governed by the 
laws of thermodynamics. In addition, our activity allows our 
intermediate-level students to practice Vision and Change
core competencies, such as applying quantitative analysis and 
mathematical reasoning to biological data, ability to use models 
to explain complex systems, and to communicate scientific 
information (2).
We evaluated whether this activity, in combination with other 
material discussed in the lecture portion of this course, was 
able to help students learn these concepts. We administered 
an anonymous survey to our most recent cohort of 37 students 
prior to the start of the laboratory period to evaluate studentsâÃÃ´ 
baseline knowledge of enzyme kinetics and inhibition. One 
week after the lesson, we asked the same questions again. In 
the second survey, we also asked several attitudinal questions 
about the activity, modeled after questions used in a previously 
published assessment of an enzyme kinetics activity (12). The 
survey protocol was reviewed and was determined to be exempt

Report Format
Each student writes a research-style paper (abstract, introduction, methods,
results, discussion, references). In class, I go over what should and should not be
included in each section and give them handouts about how to write scientific research
papers. In this course, by the time their first lab paper is due, students have already
read 4-5 primary ecology papers and so they are familiar with the structure. The
students are encouraged to work on the papers together to discuss the references I put
on reserve or what the data might indicate. The references I give them include other
similar studies done elsewhere, geologic and soil maps of the range, and other types of
ecological studies of the Holyoke Range.
Students' research papers are structured according to the following criteria (see
also links below)
Abstract: includes ecological context, why this study would be of interest to
ecologists, specific questions addressed, overview of methods, specific results and
conclusions from these data.
Introduction: explains ecological context, geologic and ecological setting, other
relevant studies and findings, specific questions addressed (2-3 pages).
Methods: enough detail so that study could be repeated but not so much as to
be tedious to read (1 page).
Results: clear explanations of tables and figures with no interpretation; tables
and figures are clean and professional (1-2 pages).
Discussion: nutshell summary of overall results, interpretation of results,
comparison with other studies, professional discussion of limitations of the study,
suggestions for follow-up studies (3-5 pages).
References: in Ecology format, 5-10 references expected.

CHALLENGES TO ANTICIPATE AND SOLVE.
I have identified 5 challenges that commonly arise:
1. making field observations: Students who are not used to making observations in the
field will need some help and special training. One way to do this is to show
slides of field sites in class and work with students on making observations first
(we call this ""page one"") and developing explanations for these second (""page
two""; see essay on this in the Teaching section. Many students have a difficult
time distinguishing between observations and interpretations. Another idea is to
go outside near your building and have students write down observations of what
they see, and back in class to discuss their observations. The next step is to help
students develop specific questions based on their observations.
2. using their observations and questions: Another skill is to use their observations and
questions in the field site to develop a project that you have already have
sketched out. You need to be open to their ideas, but the project needs focus
and must meet your course objectives. This is a very tricky balance. For the first
project of the semester especially, I tend the guide the questions a fair amount.
3. dealing with large data sets: An issue for students will be dealing with a fairly large
data set. You will have to decide how much creative chaos you find useful for
your students and how much you need to own and orchestrate to effectively
accomplish data reduction. Students who don't how to use the spreadsheet and
graphics package should be taught this ahead of time. You can do this in class or
perhaps a student assistant can do a session outside of class.
4. focusing their data set: Many students have trouble finding a focus for their paper
from this large data set. I ask them to ask specific questions that require use of
only part of the data so that they can develop a few ideas in more detail. For
instance, some students may analyze the temperature data in more depth than
others or focus on one tree species. During lab time you can ask students who
have a more focused idea to describe it to other students as an example.
5. writing a research style paper: How much time you spend teaching students how to
write scientific style research papers depends on their prior experience with this.
If they have not written such papers before take class or lab time to explain the
structure of research papers and how to write them. If the class is small enough
and if you have time, ask your students to rewrite this paper. They will benefit
enormously by doing this.

COMMENTS ON THE LAB DESCRIPTION.
This lab is a multi-week field project that I use in my undergraduate second
semester basic ecology class during February in Massachusetts. I have found that this
a good first investigation because it is based on students' own observations of tree
types and also common-sense environmental characteristics such as air temperature. In
addition, this project gets them working in the field in groups right away. Another reason
why I use this as the first investigation is because the question the students address at
the onset is fairly straightforward. The question concerns contrasts in tree species on
two very different, adjacent sites - the north and south aspects of a small mountain. This
topic also fits well with the opening of my course on autecological approaches to
ecology such as discussed in Ricklefs' chapters on ""Organisms in Physical
Environments."" During the course of this lab, the students start to work on the most
obvious questions related to climate difference, and their thinking becomes more
sophisticated as they consider more subtle issues such as disturbance history.
Questions Addressed and Ecological Context
The structure of this ecology class is bottom-up, and I use this investigation to
stimulate student thinking about physical-chemical factors contributing to local tree
distribution in a site where there is a sharp climatic gradient. In this domain, I would
expect a student to consider, for example, adaptations that might allow hemlock to grow
in colder climates. In addition, I hope that students will begin to think about other factors
affecting trees in this location. Many students quickly recognize the limitation of the
""tree-is-there-because-it-likes-it"" thinking because they see evidence of prior land use
such as grazing (e.g., juniper bushes in the woods), and they read about the 1938
hurricane that flattened trees on south facing slopes in our area. My hope is that each
student will consider the importance of additional factors such as disturbance in addition
to climate and soil in influencing tree type and size in our study site.
Time Commitment and Expected Product.
This is a largely student-developed investigation which requires a significant
amount of time. We spend two lab sessions in the field (3 hours each) and two more
labs working with computers to process the data. The students work outside of class to
write individual research papers. I provide background primary particles.

COMMENTS ON THE QUESTIONS FOR FURTHER THOUGHT.
Comments on Q1. Consider local vs. regional distribution of tree communities...
Comment for instructors: what you are looking for here is not necessarily the correct
answer but rather evidence of good ecological and scientific thinking. Help students
further develop statements and questions like: how do I know what tree communities look
like north and south of here? Is there such a thing as a typical community for a region? If
some trees are the same but others are missing, does that mean the communities are
different? What about animals; would we think they would have distributions like the
plants, and if they don't would that make a difference? Is the weather on the south slope
really like weather south of here? To prevent the discussion from being too diffuse, follow
some lines of thought with further questions about how students would test their
assumptions or get more information to address their questions.
Comments on Q2. Design a year round study to address the questions we are asking...
Comment for instructors: the kind of thinking you are looking for here is targeting data
collection to address specific questions and hypotheses (as opposed to a shot gun
approach) and more focus on critical data sets (such as more frequent sampling of
temperature in spring when changes are rapid or in mid summer when extremes might
occur).
Comments on Q3. Students in beginning ecology courses when asked why....
Comment for instructors: this questions leads to the realization that the actual
distribution of organisms is much narrower than the potential distribution (or niche if you
choose to use that term). Have students consider what factors might limit the
distribution of a plant or animal and how they would test that.
Comments on Q4. Ecology texts are often divided into sections called....
Comment for instructors: this might be a good review question towards the end of the
semester. It is important for students to recognize that the types of question an ecologist
asks depends on the type of topics that interest them.
Comments on Q5. Suppose you noticed a typically northern tree....
Comment for instructors: again you are looking for sound scientific thinking and so
strong answers would include: I would see where else hemlocks are found on the south
slope and measure their abundance. I would look to see if anything was different about
the places where hemlocks were growing, come up with a hypothesis based on those
observations, and then test the hypothesis with field studies.
Comments on Q6. Consider a totally different ecological situation where zonation....
Comment for instructors: This could be a class-wide activity in which you discuss other
locations where zonation is clearly evident. For example, seaweeds and invertebrates
are sometimes found in distinct zones on rocks in the intertidal or wetland plants are
often sharply zoned. Show slides of these places and have students first describe the
patterns they see and then develop ideas as to why these patterns exist. Have them
design experiments to test their assumptions and ideas.

Ecology, TIEE Volume 1 Â¬Â© 2004 - Ecological Society of America. (www.tiee.ecoed.net)
Additional discussion questions to use in your class:
1. Locate a data set comparing ecological communities among different habitat types
from previous student projects or published data from one of the references for this
lab or from some other source. Show and discuss data. For instance, show the air
column temperature data the students collected and ask them to predict what the
soil temperature profile might look like. Xerox temperature data from a relevant
research paper and ask students to discuss how they might use this information in
their own papers. Propose that the abundance of tree species X is related to soil
moisture, and ask students to draw figures that describe this relationship.
2. Community vs ""other"" ecologies: This study concerns some classic aspects of
community ecology including measures of relative abundance and diversity and their
physical-chemical correlates, the role of disturbance in community structure, and
gradients. However, depending on your personal interests and when during the
course you do this lab, you can also emphasize other aspects of ecology that
typically are found in chapters called ""organisms in their physical-chemical
environment"" (adaptations, abundance as a function of soil moisture). Population
ecology also could be emphasized such as age distribution of trees. This points out
of course the artificial separation of these ""ecologies"" in our textbooks. It is important
that you clearly think through the focus of your particular study and explain this very
clearly to the students. I use this as an opportunity for then to practice ""thinking like""
ecologists with differing interests.
3. Trained ecologists would quickly recognize the important of disturbance (in our
location primarily hurricanes) in this field site, but most students are slow to see
disturbance as critical. Instead of telling them about hurricanes, I hope for the ""ah-
ha"" by giving them reference material for their research papers that includes data
about New England hurricanes. I also lead a discussion in class about the role of
disturbance in other communities such as fire out west or wrack in salt marshes.
After the students hand in their papers, I ask them to talk about what disturbances
might be important in out study and the evidence they would look for. This also leads
us to discussion of the role of humans in New England forests, including native
Americans and also settlers who lived here in the 1700 and 1800's and cut down the
forests for pasture and firewood. To enrich this topic, I often bring students to a local
museum at the Harvard Forest in Petersham, MA, where there is a wonderful
diorama depicting a New England forest from pilgrim times on and dramatic photos
of hurricanes.
4. The students in my class are freshmen and sophomores and so they are just taking
or haven't yet had a statistics course. For this study I set up the excel spreadsheet
so that they can very easily do chi-square analyses of their tree data and we talk in
lab about what these numbers mean. In my experience, most students fairly quickly
understand the definition of ""significance"" sufficiently to use these data in their
papers.

required component of our biology major. As such, we assume
in this exercise that students are already familiar with the basic

Our Lesson addresses these challenges by having students map an unknown mutation to its gene using a modern suite of genetic tools. Students receive a Drosophila melanogaster strain with a mutation that causes the normally flat wing to bend at distinct sites along its length. Although we recently mapped this mutation to its gene, here we have renamed it ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂcrumpled wingÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ (cw), an example of a pseudonym that you could use in the classroom. Like many standard ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂfly labsÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ that are taught at undergraduate institutions, this Lesson reinforces classic genetics concepts: students selectively mate fly strains to determine mode of inheritance, test MendelÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs Laws, and three-point map an unknown mutation relative to known markers. But here, we expand on this tradition to simulate a more modern primary research experience: we greatly increase mapping resolution with molecularly-defined transgene insertions, deletions, and duplications; then cross-examine our data with key bioinformatic resources to identify a short-list of candidate cw genes. After extensive data interpretation and integration, students have been able to map cw to a single gene.

The class works collectively to gather a dataset, and 
class data is analyzed for the assignment, yet we want 
individuals to understand the material of this collective 
effort. With this in mind, we ask students to prioritize 
care over speed: rather than quickly scoring the requested 
number of flies, we prefer that they score fewer than 
requested and use the relaxed pace to better recognize 
the phenotypes and understand the cross genetics. (If you 
are concerned about insufficient sampling, you could 
supplement your class data with Supporting File S8. 
Mapping a Mutation âÃÃ¬ Sample Final Dataset) During the 
Week 1 and 3 Procedures (Supporting File S2. Mapping 
a Mutation âÃÃ¬ Fly Lab Manual), we encourage students 
to discuss anomalous/interesting observations rather 
than just assume that they are ""wrong"" and change their 
individual data to match group consensus.
âÃÂ¢ Encouraging student initiative: We allot class-time during 
Week 1 for students to work ahead on the Week 3 Pre-
laboratory Assignment, asking questions as needed. 
Similarly, if time is available the week before the Week 
1 class, instructors may wish to allot time for students to 
work ahead on the Week 1 Pre-laboratory Assignment.
âÃÂ¢ Welcoming a diversity of working styles: During our 
""study hall"" style office hours between Weeks 4 and 5 
(Table 1), we make every effort to accommodate different 
working styles: we reserve a large room with wireless 
access and chair arrangements that allow for small group 
or solitary work, we encourage students to collaborate 
if they wish, and they may work nearby if they prefer 
a quieter/less-crowded location. At least one instructor 
and one TA are available for questions throughout all 
study halls. If students cannot or would rather not attend 
these study halls, we are happy to meet with them at 
another time.
âÃÂ¢ Welcoming a diversity of thinking and writing styles: 
We give students explicit guidance for how to organize 
their Final Assignments. However, to help increase 
their engagement in data analysis, we ask students to 
prioritize content and a clear narrative over strict form 
(Supporting File S2. Mapping a Mutation âÃÃ¬ Fly Lab 
Manual, Guidelines for Final Assignment section). For 
example, we give them the option of writing the Results 
and Discussion separately or combined, since both forms 
are used in journal articles.
âÃÂ¢ Clear guidance while encouraging creative thinking: 
Finally, we encourage creative thinking as students 
design follow-up experiments in their Final Assignments 
(Supporting File S2. Mapping a Mutation âÃÃ¬ Fly Lab 
Manual, Guidelines for Final Assignment section; 
Supporting File S4. Mapping a Mutation âÃÃ¬ Grading Keys). 
Although we provide a clear template for mapping an 
unknown mutation to a gene, we welcome creative use 
of FlyBase and GBrowse to gather supporting evidence 
(Supporting File S2. Mapping a Mutation âÃÃ¬ Fly Lab 
Manual, Week 4 Procedure and Guidelines for Final 
Assignment).",,,No,,Yes,,"Learning Goal(s)
Students will understand how to map a mutation to its associated gene, 
just as might be done in primary research. In addition, students will 
know how to use their dataset to conduct several of the analyses that 
are taught in a standard college genetics curriculum (assessing mode of 
inheritance, chi-square tests, three-point mapping, complementation 
tests). Finally, students will apply bioinformatics to classical genetics 
to understand the integrative nature of modern research.

Learning Objective(s)
After analysis of multiple datasets and cross-examining their findings 
with bioinformatic resources, students will be able to map a mutation 
to a single gene conclusively. During this process, students will:
âÃÂ¢ handle adult Drosophila and score their phenotypes
âÃÂ¢ use Punnett squares and cross diagrams to predict outcomes of 
genetic crosses and compare these predictions to their data
âÃÂ¢ determine the mode of inheritance of a mutant trait
âÃÂ¢ use chi-square tests to determine whether the data from genetic 
crosses fit with the predictions of MendelâÃÃ´s First Law (Equal 
Segregation) and Second Law (Independent Assortment)
âÃÂ¢ three-point map an unknown mutation relative to known loci 
(a known gene and several transposable element insertions at 
known genomic locations)
âÃÂ¢ 
interpret complementation tests between the unknown mutation 
and deletions and duplications of known genomic segments
âÃÂ¢ demonstrate their ability to gather bioinformatics data from a 
model organism database (Flybase), genome browser (GBrowse), 
and search tool (BLAST)
âÃÂ¢ critically evaluate their data and hypothesize the identity of the 
unknown gene in a written lab report
âÃÂ¢ design experiments to further confirm or extend their findings ",,"Active Learning
âÃÂ¢ Hands-on learning: Students actively learn standard 
Drosophila lab work: handling cultures, setting up 
crosses, scoring fly sexes, and scoring phenotypes of 
several different tissues.
âÃÂ¢ Prediction: Pre-laboratory Assignments help students 
predict and interpret potential outcomes from all 
experimental crosses, giving them a feeling of a stake 
in the outcome.
âÃÂ¢ Data analysis: During Week 4, students use a practice 
dataset and the bioinformatic sites FlyBase and GBrowse 
to map another mutation to its gene. Students also use 
BLAST to ask questions about protein function and 
evolution. This tutorial provides a template of an effective 
research strategy which students can apply in the Final 
Assignment.
âÃÂ¢ Integrating multiple lines of evidence: In the Final 
Assignment, students: (i) determine the modes of 
inheritance of three mutant traits, (ii) use chi-square 
analyses to test the fit of their three-point cross data to 
MendelâÃÃ´s First and Second Laws, (iii) determine locus 
order with 4-5 different three-point crosses, (iv) analyze 
10-15 different complementation tests, and (v) cross-
reference their findings with FlyBase and GBrowse to 
identify the cw gene.",They are actually kind of vague about whether students are paired or not in the labs.,Paper / report / problem set; Data (hand in a dataset and/or figure); Summative Assessment,,"Assessment
âÃÂ¢ Two problem sets: Students work through two different 
Pre-laboratory Assignments (due Weeks 1 and 3). These 
short problem sets help students understand the genetics 
underlying each experimental cross.
âÃÂ¢ Practice data analysis: Throughout the Week 4 Procedure, 
instructors and/or TAs check student answers. We do not 
grade student work on Week 4, and focus on helping 
students find the correct answers if they misunderstand 
the material.
âÃÂ¢ Final lab report: Students use Week 4 Procedure as a 
template to map cw: 10-13 days after Week 4 class, 
students complete and turn in a 12-18-page Final 
Assignment that summarizes their findings.

The provided worksheet (Supporting File S4: Infection and

pair-share questions (abbreviated as TPSQ). In these sections, 
students should individually consider their own answers, and 
then pair up with another student for discussion. The output 
for these questions includes both short-answer response and 
graphing predictions of experimental outcomes.
This lesson includes many clicker questions that are used 
to probe studentâÃÃ´s interpretation and understanding of how to 
draw conclusions from data from primary literature. In the case 
of a split student response, student discussion, re-polling and 
a group discussion can be used to address misunderstanding 
and misconceptions.
Lastly, this lesson includes a section where students research 
background information and answer guided questions on HCMV 
individually using the internet. This gives students the opportunity 
to explore the information on their own and find appropriate 
sources instead of listening to a lecture. Students can also discuss

This cycling and mixing of conceptual and quantitative thinking in biology can be difficult for students. One way to help students integrate conceptual and quantitative thinking is by focusing on a single topic that has both conceptual and quantitative aspects. We have designed a curriculum that focuses on variation in experimental design and data analysis (The Biological Variation in Experimental Design and Analysis [BioVEDA] curriculum). We chose to focus on the idea of variation because it must be understood both conceptually and quantitatively at many points throughout a biological investigation. Additionally, this ability to apply quantitative thinking to biological concepts has been prioritized in national undergraduate education policy documents. Our curriculum consists of five activities that ask students to explore the idea of variation during the design of an experiment, and the representation and analysis of data. The activities are based on worksheets and incorporate Think-Pair-Share techniques with discussions facilitated by the instructor. We have implemented this curriculum twice in an introductory biology laboratory class for undergraduate students that is taught by graduate teaching assistants (TAs).

",Several class/lab periods,,,Yes,"A primary goal for this set of activities is to connect 
conceptual and quantitative thinking by exploring variation. 
This approach 
inherently 
includes multiple strategies to 
learning about the topic, a recommended approach for 
creating an inclusive learning environment for diverse learners 
(15,17). We embraced this quality by using different formats 
for student activities. For example, the activities begin with 
a whole class discussion, followed by a writing activity done 
in pairs, generating a pictorial representation, and generation 
of mathematical expressions on whiteboards in small groups. 
By incorporating multiple types of representations (pictorial, 
mathematical, graphical) and formats for students to explain 
their ideas (individual writing, peer discussion, whole class 
discussion) into the activities, we hope to broaden engagement 
to students who may value multiple representations or who 
may respond to different activity formats.
An added benefit of the formats we selected is that they are 
designed to foster a sense of collaboration among students. In 
the activities, students have discussions to select experimental 
design strategies used by the entire class section, pool data to 
explore sample sizeâÃÃ´s effect on variation, and create pictorial 
and quantitative expression in groups, in class, with instructor 
feedback and discussion. All of these activities are designed 
with collaboration and consensus building in mind. Strategies 
to increase cooperation and decrease competition, like the ones 
used in these activities, tend to increase student achievement 
and feelings of engagement 
(18,19). This 
is especially 
important in a 
lab setting, where traditional 
lab formats 
may create a sense of competition among students trying to 
complete a prescribed experiment in parallel to other students. 
In addition, recent evidence has shown that collaborative lab 
activities help eliminate achievement gaps based on previous 
science experience and science career interest, which can 
vary widely among introductory undergraduate students for 
whom these activities are designed (20).",,,Yes,,Yes,,"

Summary of What is Due
Between the first and second lab period:
each student must take a quiz on bird species identification,
each student must read about fragmentation effects on birds (Faaborg 2002, 
chapters 4-5) and generate a brief written report explaining why smaller and 
more isolated habitat fragments tend to support fewer bird species than larger 
and less isolated habitat fragments,
and each group must enter its estimates of fragment area and isolation into the 
provided spreadsheet and submit the edited spreadsheet.
After the remaining field data have been collected during the fourth lab period, each 
group must:
add the data from the bird surveys to the spreadsheet edited between weeks one 
and two and submit the edited spreadsheet,
submit statistical results and meet with the instructor to discuss interpretation of 
results,
submit a rough draft of the scientific research poster,
and present the final draft of the scientific research poster to the instructor and 
class.

In the past, the subject was taught with a series of graphs demonstrating mRNA and protein concentrations along the anterior-posterior axis. However, this pedagogy was too conceptual for the majority of students enrolled in the course. To aid their understanding, a kinesthetic model of the molecular interactions involving bicoid, nanos, hunchback, and caudal transcripts and proteins utilizing colored pipe cleaners and beads was created. Students model molecular interactions between proteins (beads) and transcripts (pipe cleaners) by placing the appropriate bead on the appropriate pipe cleaner. After working with the model, the concept of molecular interactions became more concrete to students, and they were able to conceptualize anterior-posterior axis determination in Drosophila more clearly. Throughout the rest of the course, students were able to understand molecular interactions without the aid of additional models.",9168,Douglas 2008,Augustana College,,Augustana College,"Developmental Biology at Augustana College is a 300-

Thus, hands-on experience using radio telemetry provides students with an advantage as they pursue careers in wildlife biology, as well as an opportunity to build science process skills. We present a lesson in which students use radio telemetry to track animals; collect, analyze and interpret spatial data; and consider its applications to local wildlife management and conservation.

all students an authentic research experience in class, thereby 
overcoming the time and financial limitations that prevent 
many students from engaging in research outside of class (21). 
Such equal access to research experiences may help women 
and minorities overcome the structural barriers that reduce 
their numbers in the sciences (22). Participation in a CURE has 
been linked to student gains in research skills, self-efficacy, 
and persistence in science (23-25). Additionally, our CURE 
modules are implemented through a national network that not 
only creates broad-scale datasets, but will also help students 
feel a sense of belonging to a scientific community outside their 
class, as well as validation for contributions to this broader 
community (26).

raised hands or responses to a question before any responses are 
shared), and whip around are used to foster participation of all

ample opportunity for including students with disabilities. 
Because sciurids are broadly distributed across diverse natural 
and urban habitats and are present on nearly all university and 
college campuses in North America (27) this lesson can be 
implemented in locations that allow participation of students 
with mobility disabilities. Additionally, because data collection 
requires both listening to radio telemetry receivers and visually 
locating sciurids or their sign (i.e., nests, burrows), collaboration 
of students in small groups allows participation of students with 
either visual or hearing impairments during field activities. This 
lesson can also provide flexibility in how activities are conducted

To accomplish this goal, we developed a scientific protocol for isolation of apicomplexan cysts from store-bought meat by adapting existing protocols (Cornelissen et al., 1981; Blewett et al., 1983; Dubey, 1992, 1998; Omata et al., 1997; Garcia et al., 2006). The majority of buffers used were common chemicals found in many introductory biology laboratories, and the protocol is simple enough for a freshman to use. What we found to be most challenging was modifying the experiment to fit time constraints imposed by a typical high school schedule. This experiment takes ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¼3 h. We found that the lab could be split up into 4 d for high school and 2 d for college. The teacher should make some initial preparations (i.e., making buffers and solutions) to shorten the lab period. We suggest that students split up into at least five groups of six students each. The students should be encouraged to compare and share their results. We recommend that the students spend time researching T. gondii statistics on the CDC website (www.cdc.gov) and reading newspapers to identify related topics, such as food recalls as a result of tainted product. Specifically, we suggest creating a quiz to test their knowledge of food safety and administering it before and after the exercise. We would also suggest including a follow-up discussion section investigating student response to this assignment. For example, how has completing this laboratory exercise affected their opinions about food, science, and laboratory experiments? We have listed several very useful websites in Materials and Methods. These sites are extremely helpful in providing pictures for identification purposes and background information on the parasites themselves. In addition to T. gondii, numerous other organisms (i.e., multiple types of nematodes and tapeworms) can be observed by sampling the bottom of the meat slurry instead of the supernatant. Although we had multiple years of experience at the lab bench, we found that we were surprised by the abundance and diversity of organisms in meat. It provoked us to ask the question: ""Just who is eating who?"" Although many of these pathogens are species specific and thus not a health threat to human (i.e., N. caninum), some of the organisms, such as T. gondii, are human pathogens. We realized that it reinvigorated our interest in the topic, and we were fascinated by the images in the microscope. Some of us could not eat meat for a week after doing the experiment. This realization validated for us the idea that science at the bench as opposed to simple book learning is essential for biology and nonmajors students alike. It drives home the point that well-prepared foods (washing and cooking) are a cornerstone of food safety. Carrying out this experiment familiarizes students with the microscope and more advanced isolation techniques such as the use of Percoll. It introduces some concepts about parasitology and food safety. It can be incorporated into a lesson plan covering infectious agents or health. It meets Indiana secondary school standards for advanced life sciences (standard 2: health, safety, and microbiology of food), and human anatomy and physiology (standard 10: immune mechanisms). Completion of this exercise also meets national educational standards for secondary school in the topics science as inquiry, interdependence of organisms, personal and community health, and science as a human endeavor (National Committee on Science Education Standards and Assessment, 1996). Upon completion of this exercise, the following positive outcomes are expected for students: 1) gain confidence about ability to carry out labwork and stimulate curiosity about pursuing other science classes, 2) obtain insight about health and safety of food and provide students the chance to critically evaluate articles in the newspaper regarding food recalls, and 3) change student behavior in terms of food choice, f od preparation behavior, or both. In sum, the ultimate outcome of this exercise is for students to apply the procedure to investigate a real and meaningful problem and, as a result, to describe organisms found in the meat supply, the hazards they pose, and procedures for avoiding the hazard. Because there is a compelling repulsion factor, there is a strong possibility that students would also change their behavior (either food choices or food preparation behavior). For teachers, it represents an innovative teaching strategy that provides a relatively inexpensive laboratory experience with direct student involvement that meets several national education standards.

This can cause differences in susceptibility to herbivory or differences in nutritional quality that attract herbivores. Therefore, one might expect to find differences among plants in the number of herbivores that feed on them, the ways herbivores select feeding and oviposition sites, and the success of these herbivores. In this observational experiment, students will conduct investigations of sawfly galls (Hymenoptera) on willow (Salix) trees to examine some of the ecological and possible evolutionary consequences of plant-herbivore relationships to each of the interacting species. Galls make great sampling units for investigating herbivory because they are discrete (each gall contains one herbivorous larva), quantifiable (easy to see and count), and indicative of insect preference (since each gall represents one successful oviposition by a female sawfly) and performance (successful larval development is indicated by an emergence hole). During a single lab period, students will become familiar with the plant-herbivore system and work in teams to collect data to test a general hypothesis proposed by the instructor. Teams then choose a second instructor-generated hypothesis or develop their own to test.

was attended by 12 students: 6 students with junior standing, 
5 students with sophomore standing, and 1 student with senior 
standing. Declared or anticipated majors included Biology (N = 6), 
Environmental Studies (N = 3), Russian (N = 1), English (N = 1), and 
Undecided (N = 1). Two students were unable to participate in any 
aspect of the CUREs, leaving 10 participating students separated 
into two laboratory sections. All course activities address the pri-
mary learning goal of offering rigorous exposure to the major theo-
ries and concepts that define the field of ecology and actively engage 
students in the process by which theories are tested, falsified, and 
refined. We report below how we used 5 weeks of laboratory to

The Junior Seminar in Environmental Studies (ES) at Reed, ES300, 
is an interdisciplinary, problem-oriented course that all ES students 
take in the second semester of their junior year and is co-taught by 
faculty from the natural and social sciences. The ES major at Reed 
is designed for students that seek a broad training in environmental 
themes that is anchored by a strong disciplinary focus in one of 5 
major departments: biology, chemistry, economics, political science, 
or history. Each year in ES 300, students from these disciplines come together to form an interdisciplinary team that will work together 
during the semester with the course's faculty and a local stakeholder 
to design and implement a student-led research project that aims to 
inform the climate change-related work of the stakeholder. During 
the Spring 2020 semester, the course consisted of 20 students from 
biology (N = 5), chemistry (N = 3), political science (N = 5), economics 
(N = 3), and history (N = 4). The ES 300 students worked together 
to conduct a climate change vulnerability assessment of Portland's 
natural areas for the City of Portland's Bureau of Environmental 
Services. The project was designed to allow students to build skills 
in Geographic Information Systems (GIS), quantitative data analysis 
and interpretation, primary literature review and synthesis, as well 
as working as part of an interdisciplinary, collaborative team to ad-
dress an environmental problem. During the coronavirus pandemic-
induced move to online learning in the spring of 2020, the ES 300 
students all relocated to off-campus working environments and 
were asked to complete this project and deliver it to the stakeholder.

Laboratory 2. Students select a minimum of three dark, round, glistening colonies and sub-culture (streak for isolation)each colony onto 1A-t and YEP media and incubate for two days. Students should enrich and select for pure cultures that can be used in the next laboratory to biochemically characterize isolates.

Laboratory 3. Biochemical tests inoculated include 3-ketolactose plates, SIM agar deeps, and nitrate broth. Students also perform catalase and oxidase tests and Gram stain each isolate with results recorded in this session. Cultures should be re-streaked on YEP medium for the next laboratory.

Laboratory 4. Students add reagents to biochemical tests and record results. Putative Agrobacterium colonies are re-streaked on YEP agar for the next laboratory session.

Laboratory 5. By laboratory 5 each pair of students should have three biochemically characterized isolates. Isolates are used for colony DNA preparation, with the DNA serving as the PCR template. A student group with three isolates prepares nine PCR reactions (three reactions/primer sets per isolate) and runs the reactions in the thermocycler. Completed reactions should be held at 4Â¬âC until the next laboratory session. A virG positive Agrobacterium isolate should be processed parallel to the studentsâÃÃ´ samples to serve as the positive control for all three primer sets.

This computer-based lesson gives classes/courses who are

Emphasis on visuals
Images and videos are powerful tools for engaging student 
interest. However, the visual nature of the lesson does place 
unfortunate limitations on the value for students with visual 
impairments. Many image analysis tasks done manually require 
careful mouse-work to delineate shapes or lengths on a screen. 
Thus, as written, the lesson is not well-suited for students with 
visual impairments.
There are modifications that could improve accessibility 
and benefit all students by providing other ways of encoding 
and interpreting visual information. By its nature, image 
analysis turns visual information into quantitative information - 
numerical measurements of lengths, areas, color intensities, etc.
Providing numerical metrics of visual properties of biological 
specimens could help students with visual impairments 
experience specimens (via screen readers, sonification systems, 
etc.) that would otherwise be unavailable, and may benefit all 
students by providing multiple ways of representing or encoding 
the information.
Interestingly, image analysis is often automated to improve 
speed, accuracy, and repeatability (15). A lesson that focused 
on image analysis automation could teach valuable real-world 
skills and open up participation to more students (e.g., students 
in computer science courses).
Group work
Group work, when managed well by the instructor, can 
provide an environment where the diverse assets of students 
yield a better product than any individual student could have 
created themselves. Facilitating productive collaboration 
can be challenging, though, and requires active strategies 
of the instructor. Below are some approaches we have used 
successfully. We encourage instructors to choose strategies they 
believe will be effective to ensure equal and active participation 
among their students (see 16-17 for more ideas).
Gather ideas from all group members
When groups need to pick a research question, some students 
will be more willing to share initial ideas than others. Give 
students time to think about and make a list of possible research 
questions before they form groups. Once they are in groups, ask 
students to exchange lists and read each otherâÃÃ´s ideas aloud.
Have students work individually first
Although students work on most of this lab in groups, they 
complete the regression assignment (Supporting File S9. Leaf-
cutter ants âÃÃ¬ Regression practice sheet) individually. Providing 
time for students to think through and write out their answers 
before discussing with group members helps students clarify 
what they understand and what they have questions about.
Diversify group skillsets
We find that when groups are heterogeneous with regards 
to Excel proficiency, they tend to troubleshoot technical issues 
internally instead of waiting for help from the instructor. This 
is desirable, as it encourages students to help each other and 
builds community.
Make group members accountable to each other (and 
to you!)
Two goals of this activity are to help all students become 
more comfortable creating scatterplots and performing linear 
regressions. These goals cannot be accomplished if one group 
member makes the scatterplot or runs the analysis while the 
other(s) sit passively. Tell students you expect them to actively 
contribute to every component of the module. For example, 
if one student is creating a scatterplot, their group members 
should be reviewing online tutorials or proofreading the 
graph. One strategy to keep group members accountable is to 
require students to write and turn in a log of the specific tasks 
they complete. Group members should review and sign one 
anotherâÃÃ´s logs before submission. Another strategy is to require 
students to complete anonymous peer evaluations at the end 
of each lab",,,Yes,,Yes,,"Learning Goal(s)

with the opportunity to increase their content knowledge 
and science process skills, analyze their data, and present 
their research findings in both written and oral formats, 
there are many opportunities to evaluate student learning. 
Weekly quizzes were used to assess content knowledge, 
and these quizzes focused on the lab material for the first 
six weeks and then the supplemental instruction material 
during the remainder of the semester. In order to assess 
studentsâÃÃ´ ability to develop a research question and design 
an experiment, students were required to submit their re-
search question in week two and were provided with feed-
back from their TA. Based on this feedback, the students 
then submitted a research proposal in rough draft form 
and again were provided feedback before completing the 
final draft of the research proposal. This process allowed 
for scaffolding of assignments and enabled students to 
develop and refine their ideas as the semester progressed. 
To allow the instructors to track student progress during 
their experiments, each student was required to keep a 
lab notebook that was graded weekly, as well as give an 
oral summary of project status to date. At the end of the 
semester, each group was required to write a formal lab 
report that mimicked the format of a primary research article and that included references from the primary 
literature. Each group was also required to present their 
research to the other members in their laboratory sec-
tion in the form of an oral PowerPoint presentation. The 
rubrics for these assignments can be found in Appendix C. 
One challenge with this type of laboratory experience is 
providing individual grades for work performed as a group. 
To alleviate this issue, each student in the group chose a 
role (as described above) and was therefore responsible for 
fulfilling the components associated with that role. Addition-
ally, much of the graded work was individual assignments 
such as quizzes and lab notebooks, so that by the end of the 
semester, the lab grade was approximately 80% individual 
grades and 20% group grades.",,Yes,"Cited as supplemental materials, supporting materials, or in an appendix",,Neutral,

Too often students blindly make graphs without thinking about the types of figures that would be most meaningful. Students could also examine the data and ask their own questions; you can use the ones provided to prompt further thought. In either case, you will likely need to keep asking ""how can you use these data to get at that question?"" and ""what type of graph bests presents the data to address that question""?

in both lower-level and upper-level undergraduate courses 
for students with varying backgrounds in the biological 
sciences. For these learning experiences to be successful, it 
is not required that students have prerequisite knowledge. 
All required information is given during instruction in lecture 
and/or laboratory; therefore, it encourages participation of all 
students regardless of baseline knowledge. Instruction employs 
handouts, PowerPoint slides and oral instruction, serving 
the diversity of learning needs in the classroom. As students 
work in groups in the lab and lecture, they can discuss the 
experimental protocol and results with their group members 
to aid in their understanding. We allowed self-selection of 
groups, but instructors can assign groups to increase diversity 
in each group and further promote inclusion.
Another way to improve group work and promote inclusion 
is to provide instruction on effective group work practices 
at the beginning of the project. This is especially important 
if you plan to assign a group presentation, poster, or writing 
assignment related to this project. We have developed a class 
session on effective group work and planning that can be used 
with these modules (Supporting File S5: Working in Groups - 
Lecture Slides). Finally, time is provided during lab classes to 
complete much of the group work related to this project (e.g., 
planning, data analysis), in order to be inclusive for students 
with obligations outside of class, such as work or family 
commitments.
There is diversity in the prevalence of the different ACTN3
genotypes throughout various populations, genders, and races 
(10,12-15), and students should observe this diversity when 
they conduct their literature reviews. Students are able to work 
collaboratively in their groups to conduct literature searches. 
Furthermore, classroom collaboration occurs during the 
development of the synthesis matrix and the overall project, 
when students have the opportunity to demonstrate their 
diversity of opinions and engage in productive discussions that 
ultimately result in the best experimental design.
Lastly, the phenotypic modules, which involve measurement 
of muscle phenotypes in each student, are applicable to 
individuals of varying physical capabilities, but are also made 
voluntary. On average, biological males have higher muscle 
mass than biological females, and it is therefore important 
to stratify results by biological sex during analysis of data. 
In order to account for transgender, non-binary, or other 
individuals who are uncomfortable disclosing biological 
sex, an option to not disclose biological sex is included on 
the demographic information form (Supporting File S10: 
Demographic Information Form). Collate this information 
in a manner that keeps it private. While participation in the 
physical activity and disclosure of biological sex is voluntary, 
analysis of anonymous results and data is required. We have 
found that the majority of students opt to participate in the 
experiments and disclose biological sex.""",,,Yes,Much more extensive V&C integration than in other papers (in my opinion at least),Yes,,"""Learning Goal(s)

",,"""Active learning
The laboratory modules outlined here are inquiry-based, 
teacher-collaborative research modules that can be feasibly 
used with students of all undergraduate levels. Students 
work collaboratively in self-selected groups of three to four 
individuals to first conduct a scientific literature search to 
identify a primary article that describes ACTN3 and its relation 
to a phenotype. Students work together in their groups to read 
articles, identifying specific information to share with the 
class in a synthesis matrix (described in Module 2 below). As 
students begin to examine the many approaches to genotyping 
ACTN3 and research ACTN3-related phenotypes, they can 
synthesize the information and begin to engage with the 
topic on a higher-order level. This approach allows students 
to begin to design their own experiments, thinking about the 
phenotypes they could measure in class that would be relevant 
to ACTN3 function and feasible to test in a laboratory setting. 
The synthesis matrix activity allows students to actively engage 
with the project and its experimental design, determining the 
variables to investigate and forming testable hypotheses.
Instructors can determine the amount of autonomy students 
have in choosing the phenotypes they would like to study; 
however, brainstorming the feasible options and then deciding 
which ones to actively study as a class gives the students 
ownership of the experimental design and allows them to be 
more invested in the project. Students work in their groups to 
collect data, using themselves as the study subjects each week. 
Students then perform each experiment, from isolating their 
own DNA and genotyping themselves for the ACTN3 gene 
polymorphism, to testing different muscle-related phenotypes.""",,Formative assessment; Paper / report / problem set; Data (hand in a dataset and/or figure); Summative Assessment; Other,"Self-assessment on lab learning, lab notebooks","""In the original implementation, assessment of students during 
the laboratory modules included multiple elements. Individual 
lab notebooks were collected and graded for each experiment 
based on format, inclusion of a hypothesis, reporting of data, 
analysis and interpretation of results, and overall completion. 

A brief rubric was given to students to guide them in their lab 
notebook entries (Supporting File S3: Lab Notebook Rubric), 
and we found it helpful to provide students with an example 
of a notebook entry as well. Handouts (provided as supporting 
files as indicated below) were given to students during each 
lab that included a protocol for the experiment, but also 
included questions to encourage students to think about their 
data collection and analyze their results, particularly how their 
individual genotypes for ACTN3 related to the outcomes of 
their physiological experiments.
Students were also required to write lab reports on the 
ACTN3 project. Depending on the extent of the modules 
completed for the project, each student was required to write a 
mid-project lab report and/or an end-of-project lab report. For 
the mid-project lab report, students were asked to write about 
one phenotype measured and how it related to what they 
learned about ACTN3 and its function. For the final lab report, 
students were asked to integrate background information 
about ACTN3 from literature, information they learned in 
class, results they obtained in lab for all the phenotypes they 
measured, and discuss how the class data related to what has 
been demonstrated for larger populations in the literature. 
The rubric given to students to guide them in writing their lab 
reports is provided in Supporting File S4: Scientific Writing 
Rubric.
Students were also able to self-assess how they felt about 
their learning during laboratory sessions. Throughout the entire 
project, students were invited to give anonymous feedback 
on the ACTN3 project, where they were asked to openly 
comment on how they liked or disliked the ACTN3 project 
and if/how they felt it was a valuable learning experience. At 
the end of the semester, students were administered a standard 
class evaluation from the college. One of the questions 
asked students to assess whether they felt laboratory work 
was successful as a learning experience. Both of these types 
of evaluations can be used to assess student feelings about 
the project and determine if the goals of ownership and 
engagement in the scientific process was achieved.""",,Yes,"Provided or described in detail in article text; Cited as supplemental materials, supporting materials, or in an appendix","""S1. ACTN3 Polymorphism: IRB Application

Increasing the structure of a classroom in this way benefits all 
students, but especially those who are first generation or racial

is structured in the jigsaw (19) format (Figure 1). Students first 
work independently, thinking about their own preconceptions 
about vitamin C and then evaluate a figure from one of three 
particular research studies. They then discuss their evaluations 
of the data in small groups with other students who studied 
the same figure, using prepared questions as a guide. After 
students have established expertise with that material, the 
groups reshuffle into new groups of three or more students. 
Each of the three figures should be represented by at least one 
expert in each group. Each student presents their evaluation of 
their initial figure to their new groups and answers additional 
questions on their worksheets to guide their synthesis of 
results from all three studies. The in-class activity concludes 
with a class wide discussion. The final step of the activity 
is a homework assignment that each student completes 
independently. Students write a letter to a friend or loved one

The structure of our 10-week quantitative biology CURE
includes 1 weekly 3-h wet lab session, currently offered in the
Molecular Prototyping and BioInnovation Lab at UC Davis, as
well as a 1-h weekly lecture held in a traditional classroom.
The lectures cover the quantitative theory associated with the
hands-on research experience and connect this theory to the lab
applications (Supplementary File S2). Students also complete a
weekly homework that combines a lab write-up with quantitative
problem-solving. As the course transitions into student projects,
student learning is assessed with an initial project proposal, a final
written report, and an oral group presentation
The lab starts with an introduction to formal campus and
site-specific lab safety training. We require all students to
successfully complete the University of California ""Fundamentals
of Laboratory Safety Training,"" an online course required for
everyone who works in labs on campus. We explain to the
students that this training certifies them to work in faculty
research labs on campus. The site-specific training highlights that
the workspace is used outside of class hours to host active student
research projects (i.e., they are working in a ""real"" research space
and not just a classroom and thus that we expect them to be
aware of those activities and associated hazards as they work). We
emphasize this training to provide a solid foundation in safety,
but also to establish a classroom environment in which students
feel like they are doing authentic research.
Following the safety training, an introductory activity on
pipetting, mixing, and measurement teaches techniques and
orients students to the various instruments and supplies in
the lab required for the course. These hands-on exercises are
complemented with lecture and homework in which students
develop their understanding of measurement and sources of
error. For example, in one activity students repeatedly pipette and
weigh an identical volume of solution. During lecture students
had previously learned about accuracy and precision and how
these can be quantified, and on the homework students use the
programming language R (R Core Team, 2019) to calculate these
quantities for their self-collected measurements. This pattern
of linked lecture, lab, and homework continues throughout the
quarter as each student collects (or selects previously collected)
environmental samples, progresses through microbial isolation,
and phenotypically characterizes the isolates.",,Formative assessment; Paper / report / problem set; Presentation; Other,proposal,"Students also complete a

While intended to develop experimental design skills in an upper-level undergraduate biology course, instructors can adapt the activity to suit biochemistry and introductory biology courses.",8882,Ganser 2021,Lafayette College,,Lafayette College,"This activity was used in an upper-level biology course at a 
selective, undergraduate-only liberal arts college in the mid-
Atlantic United States. Immediately following completion of 
the activity, 46 students were surveyed. Of the students in the 
sample who reported their class year, 93% were in their fourth 
year of college, 4.4% were in their third year, and 2.2% were 
in their second year. Of those who reported their major, 69% 
were specifically biology majors, and 98% had majors in STEM 
fields. The intended audience however is undergraduates at 
any level of progression and both STEM and non-STEM majors. 
The activity is appropriate for Introductory Biology, Zoology, 
Physiology, Biochemistry, or other similar laboratory courses",Yes,Yes,Yes ,In-person,Lab,Discussion; Groupwork; Metacognitive activities; Practicing core competencies; Laboratory activity,,,25-50,Upper-level (Junior/Senior),,Biology Majors; Non-Biology Majors,,No,,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,,"The activity, designed to occur during 
a single three-hour lab meeting, allows students to experimentally explore the mechanisms of the taste-altering miraculin 
protein, found in the fruit of Richadella dulcifica, commonly known as miracle fruit. ",1 class/lab period,,Complements a CURE,Yes,"Many factors are likely to affect an individual studentâÃÃ´s 
exposure to experimental design inside and outside of the 
classroom. These include, but are not limited to, socioeconomic 
status and first-generation status. Instructors of upper-level 
courses might assume that students have a refined understanding 
of experimental design by that point in their education. However, 
depending on the quality of introductory courses that students 
have experienced, this may not be the case. The same is true 
with respect to the inequities among first-year students and 
their high school courses. The miraculin activity does not make 
assumptions as to a studentâÃÃ´s level of experimental design 
experience. It seeks to correct misconceptions and encourages 
peer support. Additionally, students are encouraged to share 
their past experience or inexperience with experimental design. 
Students are given many opportunities and contexts in which 
to express their knowledge, questions, and concerns. They
can express their knowledge in a written manner via pre-lab 
questions (Supporting File S4. Miracle Fruit - Pre-lab Questions), 
the laboratory protocol (Supporting File S5. Miracle Fruit - 
Laboratory Protocol), and the post-activity reflection survey 
(Supporting File S3. Miracle Fruit - Exit Survey). They can also 
share knowledge verbally with the instructor one-on-one or 
during a class discussion. They express their knowledge to peers 
both within and outside of their lab groups. Therefore, students 
can choose to whom, when, and in what format they share 
what they have learned. The level of student choice exhibited 
throughout the experimental design process allows students 
to tailor their learning in a way that makes sense to them, 
promoting inclusivity by allowing different students to learn 
and experience the activity in different ways. Particularly, this 
contributes to inclusivity for students with disabilities because 
it gives them the opportunity to express information in ways 
that work for them. For example, choosing to present ideas 
verbally rather than in writing may help students with certain 
disabilities. On the other hand, students with disabilities related 
to interpersonal interactions can choose to express their ideas 
in writing. In general, active learning increases performance 
of underrepresented and first-generation students by a larger 
margin than other students (16). Since this activity contains 
many elements of active learning, it should therefore contribute 
to inclusivity.
Additionally, the activity allows students to bring their cultural 
experiences into the classroom and share them with their 
classmates. For example, students are encouraged to bring in 
foods that are culturally relevant to them. This shows students the 
importance of representative sampling in experimental designs. 
By giving students freedom, the activity encourages them to 
challenge dominant narratives in science. For example, students 
from non-Western backgrounds may identify variables or design 
flaws that Westernized science might miss. This could generate 
a class discussion after the activity about the relationship 
between experimental design, diversity, Westernization, and 
drawing conclusions.",,,Yes,,Yes,,"Learning Goals
Students will:
âÃÂ¢ develop skills to confront the obstacles that are an inherent part of 
designing an objective experiment
âÃÂ¢ be exposed to the dynamic nature of macromolecules

Students will be able to:
âÃÂ¢ propose a testable hypothesis when given a problem.
âÃÂ¢ design appropriate data collection methods to test a hypothesis.
âÃÂ¢ work cooperatively to complete a task and report results.
âÃÂ¢ identify potential confounds when designing an experiment.
âÃÂ¢ articulate the role that biochemistry plays in human physiology",,"The miraculin activity exhibits many of the components of 
active learning outlined in a 2014 meta-analysis of active-
learning studies, as well as in other literature (2,14,15). For 
example, studies have shown that verbal communication with 
instructors and peers plays a key role in student learning during 
active assignments (5). Real-time instructor feedback is a key 
component of this lesson. Students work in small groups, so the 
activity is social in nature. However, students are additionally given the freedom by the instructor to communicate with peers 
in other groups. This encourages the articulation and sharing of 
thought patterns, a key component of active learning. A class 
discussion of results at the conclusion of the experiments also 
requires students to communicate their results. Students actively 
drive their own learning by asking and answering self-designed 
research questions and forming hypotheses relative to these 
questions. Students also generate their own data collection 
mechanisms. Overall this activity epitomizes inquiry-based 
learning, and therefore takes on an active nature.",,Formative assessment; Paper / report / problem set; Presentation; Other, lab notebook (optional),"In order to facilitate maximum student freedom and 
exploration, we did not formally assess this activity. After the 
lab, students were asked how they might refine or extend their 
experimental designs, and in this way they assessed their own 
learning (Supporting File S5. Miracle Fruit - Laboratory Protocol). 
They were also given a survey in which they assessed their 
learning of both experimental concepts and receptor binding 
(Supporting File S3. Miracle Fruit - Post-Activity Survey). Since 
one of our primary goals was to maximize studentsâÃÃ´ abilities 
to take risks and explore the scientific process, we chose to 
avoid extensive written assignments. While this activity was not 
formally assessed through a graded assignment, the instructor 
assessed studentsâÃÃ´ initial design proposals before they completed 
their experiment and provided real-time feedback (Supporting 
File S5. Miracle Fruit - Laboratory Protocol). The instructor used 
class discussions to monitor student learning throughout the 
activity in the absence of a formal assessment.
We recognize that other instructorsâÃÃ´ goals may differ and may 
require a formal assessment. If this is the case, there are many 
feasible options. Pre-lab questions relating to the Misaka article 
could be graded as a gauge of what students understood prior 
to completing the activity (Supporting File S4. Miracle Fruit - 
Pre-lab Questions). Additionally, if a summative assessment is 
desired, the instructor could require that student groups formally 
present their experimental design, results, and limitations to the 
class, thus assessing quality of design and communication. The 
instructor has the choice of assigning a formal lab report to be 
completed by students, either in their groups or individually, 
outside of class after the activity. The instructor could also require 
students to keep a detailed account of their scientific question, 
procedure, and results in a lab notebook format and utilize this 
as an assessment if they choose.",,Yes,"Cited as supplemental materials, supporting materials, or in an appendix",,Easy,

In this research-based introductory laboratory course, first-year students acquired basic lab skills not just for their own sake, but rather within the context of a research question of a member of the faculty. Student projects investigated potential neuroanatomical changes in animal models of dyslexia and aging and included measurements of neuron numbers and levels and distribution of neuronal proteins.

are analysed using blood differentials and in the peritoneal cavity

between the innate and adaptive immune response; students
analyze the effect of a particular substance on the ability of
cultured macrophages to phagocytose latex beads. Students are
first introduced to cell culture and are assigned a culture of THP-
1 cells to take care of for the week. Next, each group brainstorms
a list of substances/compounds that they hypothesize might
affect phagocytosis such as garlic extract, honey, particular
vitamins/minerals, etc. The class agrees on a substance and
designs an experiment to test the effect of the chosen substance
on the ability of THP-1 cells to phagocytose FITC-coated beads.

concentration, and the timing of application of the substance
to the culture. Note that if a flow cytometer is not available, an

experiences 
increase 
inclusivity 
in 
science education 
(1,2,3,8,9,10). To enhance the impact of the CURE model, I 
integrated group work throughout the module, encouraging 
students to divide tasks in ways that took advantage of diverse 
skill sets. For example, in the field students worked in pairs 
or small groups to collect data. Individuals more comfortable 
managing binoculars would spot birds while record keepers 
consulted Merlin Bird ID and kept notes.
When setting up experimental design and working groups, 
instructors must keep in mind time constraints, transportation 
needs, and mobility limitations that might affect students. For 
group projects, an important challenge is scheduling time 
outside of class when all members of the group are available. 
Field work, which must be amenable to a variety of factors 
including weather conditions, further complicates this effort. 
For this reason, I set aside dedicated class time for field data 
collection. When groups collected data at off-campus sites, 
we organized carpools to ensure everyone had a ride. For 
most of my students, mobility was not a limitation for walking 
transects. Also, some of our sites were wheel-chair accessible. 
However, as mentioned earlier walking transects is only one 
method of sampling. Spot-sampling, where the group remains 
in one place and records birds over a set period, is another 
option.
In situations where students cannot participate in group 
fieldwork, alternative plans should be developed. For 
example, one of my students was on maternity leave during 
the field work portion of the CURE project. Instead of joining 
an assigned group, she collected her own data on residential 
birds in her neighborhood. She then rejoined the class for data 
analysis, group discussion, and the final reports at the end of 
the semester. Many approaches can be taken to implementing 
this module. In the interests of inclusion, it is important to 
remain flexible and avoid a one-size-fits-all mindset.
As a citizen science platform with global reach, eBird 
appealed to all my students, who represented diverse racial, 
ethnic, economic, and international backgrounds. At the start 
of this project, none of my students had worked with birds, and 
some were skeptical of the project objectives. By the end of 
the semester, all had gained from and enjoyed the experience, 
as evidenced by assessment results as well as informal and 
formal feedback (see Teaching Discussion, below)",,,Yes,,Yes,,"Learning Goal(s)

âÃÂ¢ What is biodiversity at the genetic, species, and functional (niche) 
level within an area, a biome, or on the earth?
âÃÂ¢ How do species interact with their habitat?
âÃÂ¢ What impacts do humans have on ecosystems?

Students will be able to:
âÃÂ¢ Apply technology and field-based skills (such as bird identification 
and use of binoculars) to contribute to a citizen science database.
âÃÂ¢ Collaborate as part of a group in the design and implementation of

their study, working in partners or small groups to collect and 
analyze their own data. Students interpret and communicate 
their results in the form of oral and written reports",,Formative assessment; Exam; Paper / report / problem set; Quiz; Data (hand in a dataset and/or figure); Summative Assessment; Other,self assessment of learning," I assessed student skills in using binoculars, 
Merlin BirdID, and eBird in the Introductory Mini-Labs and 
quizzes. For example, as part of the first mini-lab, students 
completed a quiz over basic techniques of bird identification 
and external anatomy. As an assessment of their ability with 
Merlin BirdID, students used the app to identify model birds 
in the lab and on campus. Student contribution to the citizen 
science database was measured by the sum-total of birds 
reported as part of the class project. In the first semester I 
implemented this module, Conservation Biology students 
reported 368 individuals representing 33 species during five
weeks of data collection in eight urban habitats. In the second 
semester, Introduction to Research students reported 134 
individuals representing 29 species during three weeks of data 
collection in three urban habitats.
Collaborated as part of a group in the design and 
implementation of a field study. I assessed this objective based 
on the overall success of the group project with respect to 
two criteria: whether the class identified and tested a clear 
hypothesis, and efficacy of group collaboration during data 
collection. With respect to the first measure, Introduction to 
Research students were more successful at identifying a clear 
hypothesis that they tested by gathering data from a small 
number of study sites. This also facilitated a better organization 
of group work in the field and more meaningful analysis and 
interpretation of the final data set. Conservation Biology 
students were enthusiastic about sampling a wide range of 
habitats across the city (and very successful in doing so), but 
had a harder time consolidating their efforts into a focused 
class question and hypothesis.
Analyzed and interpreted original data. I assessed this 
objective based on questions answered in the Data Analysis 
Lab completed by the students. The 
lab report included 
qualitative and quantitative analyses as well as questions 
regarding 
interpretation of the data. Qualitative analyses 
included detailed descriptions of habitats studied as well as 
natural history summaries of designated âÃÃ²species of interest.âÃÃ´ 
Quantitative analysis included calculation of the SimpsonâÃÃ´s 
Index and comparison of indices across habitats studied. At 
the end of the lab report, students wrote a brief summary of 
their results and provided a statement as to whether the results 
supported the class hypothesis. During the data analysis lab, 
students worked in small groups to complete the lab, but they 
submitted individual reports.

Communicated their results in the form of a written report. 
I assessed this objective based on individual written reports 
submitted by students at the end of the semester. The second 
semester I ran the module, I used a âÃÃ²short form,âÃÃ´ while in the 
first semester, I used a âÃÃ²long form.âÃÃ´ The short form is essentially 
a partial scientific paper that includes a statement of hypothesis 
and predictions as well as âÃÃ²ResultsâÃÃ´ and âÃÃ²DiscussionâÃÃ´ sections. 
For the long form, students completed a habitat assessment 
based on the class data. The short form appeared more effective 
in terms of meeting the objectives of the module. By narrowing 
the focus of the written report, students could concentrate on 
the meaning of the data and better contextualize their study 
within a larger body of literature.
Defined species diversity and articulated correlates of 
species diversity based on original data and the scientific 
literature. Students addressed this objective by completing a 
report for the Data Analysis Lab. They also participated in class 
discussions and submitted final written reports. On the final 
exam for both courses, I included an essay question that asked 
students to apply what they learned from the CURE project 
to a habitat management scenario on the university campus. 
Finally, at the end of the semester, students completed a 
written self-assessment of what they learned about biodiversity 
from completing the research experience.

form a serial dilution, and plate onto media with and without 
tetracycline (Fig. 1). Two different levels of tetracycline are 
used, one of low concentration and one of higher concentra-
tion. Students then count CFUs and perform calculations 
to determine percent resistance. Student-generated data 
are uploaded into a database after reviewing for accuracy 
during an in-class activity. In best practice, students form a 
hypothesis about sources of potential antibiotic resistance 
and choose soil sample collection locations based on the 
hypothesis. This can either be done in individual groups, or 
as a discussion among the whole class. During soil collection, 
students record collection site characteristics such as GPS

strategies that help to build classroom community. When 
participating in these activities, students work collaboratively 
in small groups (of 3-5 students that they select) on several 
formative assessments, which provides them with the opportunity 
to make their voices heard, draw on each otherâÃÃ´s strengths, and assist each other with data interpretation (47). The small group 
questions are either discussed as an entire class or asked about 
in follow up clicker questions (Supporting File S1. Speciation 
and Conservation âÃÃ¬ Presentation Slides with Instructor Notes; 
Supporting File S2. Speciation and Conservation âÃÃ¬ Discussion 
After Application Worksheet Activity). Students earn points for 
participating in the clicker questions and are not scored based 
on selecting the correct answer. This grading policy supports 
the message that students should think about the questions and 
get help when they are incorrect, rather than worry about the 
grade. More information about using this scoring scheme can be 
found in a recent review about using clicker questions in biology 
courses (48). For the summative assessment, we employed a 
two-stage exam design (49,50) at the end of the semester, where 
students first answer the questions as individuals, turn in their 
individual answers, and then work in small randomly-assigned 
groups to answer the questions again. The group part inspired 
lively discussions where students explain their thinking and 
provided each other with immediate feedback.
We also designed the lesson to emphasize diverse perspectives 
and frame speciation in a way that endeavors to be both relevant 
and engaging. Before the start of the lesson, students are asked 
to submit photos of animals that are symbolically significant to 
their own cultures or identities, which are then incorporated into 
the lecture slides (Slide 13 of Supporting File S1. Speciation and 
Conservation âÃÃ¬ Presentation Slides with Instructor Notes). This 
assignment has several potential benefits, including that students 
feel valued in seeing their chosen animal represented on the slide 
and learn about their peersâÃÃ´ backgrounds. To build upon this 
personal investment, we focused our lesson around the giraffe, 
which invites strong public engagement from communities and 
conservationists across the globe.
To be mindful of students who may have a color vision 
deficiency, we carefully designed the figures in the slides 
(Supporting File S1. Speciation and Conservation âÃÃ¬ Presentation 
Slides with Instructor Notes; Supporting File S2. Speciation and 
Conservation âÃÃ¬ Discussion After Application Worksheet Activity) 
to be distinct in terms of color and shape and tested them through 
a colorblindness simulator (https://www.color-blindness.com/
coblis-color-blindness-simulator/).
Students are also exposed to scientists from diverse 
backgrounds throughout the lesson (e.g., Slides 21, 97, and 98 
of Supporting File S1. Speciation and Conservation âÃÃ¬ Presentation 
Slides with Instructor Notes). These scientists differ in terms of 
age, ethnicity, gender, geographical location, and academic/
professional backgrounds. Our goal here is to break down 
societal barriers to inclusion in science by promoting the message 
that there are multiple paths to becoming a scientist (51).
StudentsâÃÃ´ socioeconomic diversity was also an important 
consideration in our lesson design; students are not required 
to purchase any textbooks or other supplementary materials to 
successfully participate in the lesson. Moreover, all formative 
and summative assessment questions that accompany this lesson

or use a bubble sheet to record the answers. Each question 
aligns with at least one of the lessonâÃÃ´s four learning objectives. 
Since the pre-test is a measure of student understanding prior to 
the lesson, students should be asked to not consult any outside 
resources when taking it and should be told in advance that 
their answers will not be graded for correctness. The pre-test 
questions should not be discussed during the lesson because 
the same questions will be used after the lesson as the post-test.
During lesson: Students engage in a variety of formative 
assessments, including in-class clicker questions (Supporting File 
S4. Speciation and Conservation âÃÃ¬ Clicker Questions), think-pair-
share opportunities (e.g., where students think about a question,\
turn to someone near them, and share their ideas), collaborative 
group discussions, and a worksheet activity (Supporting File S3. 
Speciation and Conservation âÃÃ¬ Student Worksheet Packet). These 
formative assessments provide timely feedback to the instructor 
and help students self-evaluate their own learning.
Immediately after lesson: After the speciation lesson is 
complete (i.e., after all class sessions for this lesson), students 
take a short online post-test that is identical to the pre-test 
(Supporting File S4. Speciation and Conservation âÃÃ¬ Pre/Post-Test 
Questions) using a course management system. We recommend 
that students receive a small number of participation points (less 
than 1% of their course grade) for completing the post-test. 
If an online course management system is not available, the 
post-test questions can be administered via paper hardcopies, 
as suggested for the pre-test.
Exam: The instructor can also measure longer-term student 
retention by including questions about speciation on an exam 
(Supporting File S6. Speciation and Conservation âÃÃ¬ Exam 
Questions). The exam questions are different from the pre/
post-test questions and address the learning objectives.",,Yes,"Cited as supplemental materials, supporting materials, or in an appendix",,Easy,

The challenge for science instructors has been to design lab exercises that incorporate both active and experiential learning. In this vein, in this Essay I describe how I modified a previously introduced Lesson using a primary cell culture model to study a specialized structure found within in the neural extracellular matrix, named the perineuronal net. When I taught this exercise originally, the students had completed the majority of the experiment in person, but to adapt to online learning, changes were made to Lab Sessions 3 and 4. Since students were not able to perform the analysis portion of the exercise, I provided images and the students were still tasked with completing a lab report. I made the handouts, information about the lab report, the rubric, and PowerPoints available through the learning management system. Herein, I also reflect on how an instructor could modify the entire four-week experiment to be conducted virtually. In the adapted exercise, students play a leading role in researching protocols, explaining why each step is carried out, establishing hypotheses, and drawing support for these statements from the literature.

the instructor should keep in mind that they should provide 
notes, audio, as well as video to accommodate students with 
disabilities. I also recommend following up individually with

and antibiotic resistance respectively). Also, in the Sequence- 
and Function-Based Metagenomics lab module, an informal 
presentation was given. In the Bioinformatic Analysis of 
Metagenomes lab module, the students performed specific 
bioinformatic analysis activities as directed in the handout 
and recorded their results. For each of the lab modules, 
short-answer questions were provided in the handout, 
which the students used to check their understanding of the material. Summative assessment for the purpose of as-
signing a grade was accomplished through prelab and major 
quizzes. Detailed descriptions of the assessment tools can 
be found in Appendix 4. 
To determine student learning of metagenomics 
concepts and the effectiveness of the metagenomics lab 
modules, a pre-/posttest assessment was designed. This 
assessment consisted of eight multiple-choice content ques-
tions, four student information questions, and one control 
question (Appendix 5). We encouraged students to take the 
assessment by offering them bonus points for completion 
of the pre-/posttests. Students who scored less than 50% 
on these tests earned one bonus point, and students who 
scored greater than 50% earned two bonus points.

Here we present a hands-on, inquiry-based classroom activity to study host-parasite coevolution. Coevolution is the reciprocal evolution of interacting species. It is pervasive, diverse, and rapid. Instruction in coevolution is therefore an excellent way to teach students evolutionary principles. In the described game, students take on the role of either host or parasite, and they use playing cards to act out reciprocal selection. Students collaborate to collect data on the change in frequency of host and parasite genotypes (card suits) through time. They use these data to conduct an independent test of the prediction that host-parasite coevolution maintains genetic variation.

In most cases, GMOs are discussed in the context of introducing a single protein-coding gene to produce a single desired trait in a crop. For example, a commercially available kit allows students to test whether food products contain GMOs by detecting the Bacillus thuringiensis delta-endotoxin gene, which confers resistance to European corn borers. We have developed an 8-week laboratory module for upper-division undergraduates and graduate students that builds upon students' basic understanding of GMOs to introduce them to the techniques used to sustainably produce commercially valuable products in yeast through metabolic engineering. In this course, students use recombination-based methods to assemble genes encoding entire metabolic pathways in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, perform genetic screens to identify yeast genes that impact metabolite yield, and use error-prone PCR to optimize metabolic pathway function. In parallel to these laboratory-based activities, students engage with the societal impact of these approaches through case studies of products made via yeast metabolic engineering, such as opioids, omega-3 fatty acids, and the Impossible Burger. In this report, we focus on these case studies as well as an individual sustainability project assignment created for this course. This assignment, which spans the 8-week module, asks students to find examples of yeast metabolic engineering that could be used to address current sustainability challenges in their communities. By the end of the course, students synthesize this information to create a case study that could be used to teach concepts related to metabolic engineering and sustainability to their peers. Student approaches to this project have varied from literature reviews, to news searches, to directly contacting and interviewing researchers using novel metabolic engineering approaches. These student-produced projects are used as case studies in future semesters, amplifying student voices and contributing to student ownership. While developed in the context of this course, the sustainability project and case studies are broadly applicable and could be adapted for use in biology or bioethics courses at the undergraduate or graduate level.

critically about how yeast was used to produce the Impossible
Burger (Case Study 1), opioids (Case Study 2), and omega-
3 fatty acids (Case Study 3). Several questions then asked
participants to compare the methods and approaches used
in the different case studies. All cases included questions

learn science. However, since this approach is flexible, it is 
appropriate for diverse audiences, including advanced courses 
for science majors. The curricular approach is particularly 
well-suited for students who are English language learners and 
students with disabilities. To make graphic memoirs accessible 
for students who are blind or have low vision, PDFs accessible 
to text-to-speech software can be produced with the support of 
the universityâÃÃ´s office for students with disabilities. Resources 
for making comics accessible include LearningAlly (
), an organization which produces graphic novels in an 
audiobook format; a description of how one faculty member 
made comics accessible with PDFs accessible to text-to-
speech software (
); and an explanation

The course is taught at Gallaudet University, a university 
with a uniquely chartered mission to serve deaf and hard of 
hearing students. This means that classroom teaching and 
learning is bilingual: we use texts composed in English and 
ASL and communicate with one another using ASL. The course 
is a four-credit 200-level class that meets twice a week for 2 
hours in a 15-week semester. The course serves 12-21 students 
led by one instructor, but this curricular approach could be 
scaled for a larger class. The course is not required and serves 
mostly non-science majors with limited science backgrounds.

Students often see science as a fragmented set of facts to be memorized, rather than concepts and processes that are relevant 
in their everyday lives. This is especially true for non-science majors, who represent the vast majority of all college students. 
Including long-form comics, such as graphic memoirs, in the curriculum, is one approach to making science relevant. 
This curricular approach is designed to humanize biology so that students are motivated to understand the relationship 
between science and issues that they face in their lives. As a class, we read graphic memoirs about pressing socio-scientific 
issues, specifically, infertility, cancer, and AIDS. Graphic memoirs grab studentsâÃÃ´ attention, creating a ""need to know."" Once 
studentsâÃÃ´ interest is piqued, we delve deep into the biology of these issues, using a variety of active learning approaches to 
scaffold student learning. Comics can serve as powerful entry point to science; ""story-ifying"" science makes it come alive 
for non-scientists. By engaging with graphic memoirs, students come to see science as meaningful in their own lives beyond 
the classroom. A list of potential graphic non-fiction narratives and topics is provided.",Several class/lab periods,,,Yes,"This curricular approach ""story-ifies"" science as a creative 
entryway to biology, which piques studentsâÃÃ´ curiosity. The vast 
majority of college students (82%) are non-science majors, and 
so this curricular approach may make biology more relevant 
to them (2). Further, our classes are increasingly composed of 
students with disabilities, including deaf and hard-of-hearing 
students, and students who are English language learners. 
Comics benefit these learners and all students by using visual 
communication rather than relying on words alone. In this way, 
challenging scientific concepts can be clearly communicated 
while supporting English 
language 
learners. Additionally, 
visual communication is an important strategy to engage the 
bilingual (American Sign Language (ASL) and English) Deaf 
community in science (11).",,,Yes,,Yes,,"Students will appreciate the science involved in contemporary 
issues we face in society (AAAS 2010).
Learning Objective(s)
Students will:
âÃÂ¢ be motivated to learn science related to specific socio-scientific 
issues.
âÃÂ¢ learn science that applies to specific socio-scientific issues.
âÃÂ¢ be able to discuss the relationship between science and society, 
as well as the biology behind the issue, related to specific socio-
scientific issues.",,"Several active 
learning strategies are employed 
in this 
curricular approach. First, students engage with the books, 
which spurs a ""need to know"" more, encouraging further 
biology 
learning. Students read the graphic memoirs as 
part of their homework assignments. Activities are designed 
for students to search and identify high quality sources of 
scientific information to address learning objectives on their 
homework assignments. StudentsâÃÃ´ learning is self-directed, 
using library searches, Internet searches, and databases such 
as PubMed to search for scientific information. In class, active 
learning techniques 
including think-pair-share and small 
group, as well as whole-class discussion about the books and 
the biology background of the issues presented, are used to 
support student learning. Student groups are often asked to 
share what they learned through their homework, using peer-
teaching techniques.",,Formative assessment; Paper / report / problem set; Quiz; Other,"reflective essays, comic","A variety of assessment opportunities are used to evaluate 
studentsâÃÃ´ progress toward achieving our learning objectives. 
First, daily class discussions, both as a class, and through small 
group discussions, allow for assessment of studentsâÃÃ´ content 
knowledge, their motivation to learn the science related to the 
graphic memoirs, and their ability to discuss the relationship 
of biological concepts to each issue (discussion questions and 
prompts are provided in Supporting File S2: Using ComicsâÃÃ®
Example PowerPoint). During in-class discussion and small 
group discussion, the instructor informally assesses student 
learning with relation to biology content, in order to make 
just-in-time adjustments to the mini-lectures.
Students are prepared for in-class discussions via low stakes 
assignments such as homework and quizzes. These low stakes 
help to keep students accountable for their learning, while 
assessing studentsâÃÃ´ content knowledge related to the specific 
socio-scientific issues our class tackles. Quizzes primarily 
focus on related biology content and studentsâÃÃ´ reading of 
the graphic memoirs. Numerical grades are provided for 
homework via the course learning management system (LMS). 
In large enrollment courses, this might be substituted with a 
binary grading format (e.g., complete / incomplete). While 
our class utilizes quick 5-minute in-class quizzes on paper, 
quizzes could alternatively be on the course LMS or taken via 
clicker questions.
For each unit, two reflective essays are used to assess
studentsâÃÃ´ motivation to learn science and their appreciation 
of the science involved in contemporary issues, as well as to 
evaluate studentsâÃÃ´ learning of related biology content. On the 
pre-essay, students are asked to explain what they know about 
the biology of the topic, for example, ""Describe what you know 
(or you think you know) about infertility and reproduction."" 
On the post-reflective essay, students are asked, for example, 
""Explain the most important concepts you learned about 
infertility and reproduction. What information do you think 
people should know and why? Now, what are you curious to 
learn more about?""
Finally, students are asked to develop an end-of-course 
comic reflecting on their learning throughout the semester as 
a means to assess their motivation to learn science and their 
appreciation of the science involved in contemporary issues (a 
rubric is provided in the PowerPoint in the Supporting File S3:

The incorporation of classroom activities on both days of 
this two-day lesson plan is meant to engage undergraduate 
students in meaningful ways that will increase student 
learning (16). The goal of these classroom activities is to 
stimulate critical thinking on issues related to natural resource 
management and environmental sustainability. Specifically, 
the Seafood Watch activity on Day 1 uses small-group learning 
and the stakeholder analysis activity on Day 2 uses role-play 
and think-pair-share. Our use of the think-pair-share technique 
in the stakeholder assessment allows us to be inclusive of 
students who prefer individual work as well as students who 
prefer group work. Importantly, this allows students who are 
intimidated by group work to have a moment to work on their own (i.e., think) and build up confidence (i.e., pair) before 
reporting to the larger group (i.e., share).
We also use place-based examples to illustrate some of 
the seafood traceability issues. Overall, the issue of seafood 
sustainability is already economically relevant to the state 
of Rhode Island where marine-based industries form a large 
sector of the economy. Using images of local restaurants 
and other stakeholders in the presentation slides increased 
the place-based nature of the lesson plan. Similarly, basing 
the Seafood Watch activity off a menu from a local seafood 
restaurant enhanced the authenticity of the activity. 
Accordingly, we encourage instructors to locate a menu from 
a local seafood restaurant for their own classes. Some student 
populations may be significantly less connected to seafood 
for cultural and/or geographic reasons. In this case, the best 
approach for connecting to these students may be through the 
use of fast food examples. Many popular fast food chains have 
seafood items on the menu, with varying levels of disclosure 
regarding from where they are sourced (e.g., imported shrimp 
vs. Alaskan Pollock vs. North Pacific cod). Instructors could 
modify the Seafood Watch Activity such that students are asked 
to compare seafood options from multiple fast food chains",,,No,,Yes,,"Learning Goal(s)

In our introductory fisheries and aquaculture course, 
students were assessed using both formative (think-pair-share, 
small-group student participation, and classroom discussions) 
and summative (post-class reflection; Supporting File S5. 
Seafood Traceability âÃÃ¬ Post-Class Reflection) methodologies. 
In both cases, the emphasis was on studentsâÃÃ´ ability to explain 
their opinions, rather than their ability to recall details from 
the lectures.
The formative assessments consist of two classroom-based 
activities (i.e., the Seafood Watch activity on Day 1 and the 
stakeholder analysis on Day 2). For both, students are given a participation grade related to these activities. For the Seafood 
Watch activity, instructors should be prepared to lead a 
class discussion on each groupâÃÃ´s choice of seafood. While 
each group should be prepared to report and explain their 
particular choice, the discussion and assessment should focus 
on overall observations about the activity (Supporting File S6. 
Seafood Traceability âÃÃ¬ Restaurant Activity Discussion). What 
information did the students observe to be missing from the 
menu that would otherwise have aided them in making their 
choice? Was there any additional information they would like 
to see included in the Seafood Watch app? Did they have any 
hesitations about the process of making responsible consumer 
decisions? Similarly, for the Day 2 stakeholder analysis, 
less emphasis should be placed on the expected answers of 
each stakeholder groupâÃÃ´s needs (Supporting File S4. Seafood 
Traceability âÃÃ¬ Day 2 Presentation Slides: slide 44), and more 
on studentsâÃÃ´ reasoning for their answers.
The summative post-class reflection (Supporting File S5. 
Seafood Traceability âÃÃ¬ Post-Class Reflection) asks students 
to provide and explain their opinions on natural resource 
management. For example, how has the issue of seafood 
traceability changed your opinions about who should be 
responsible for natural resource management? Should 
environmental stewardship mainly be the responsibility of 
individual consumers, businesses, or governments? How 
important is scientist input to environmental management 
and policy-making? Instructors who wish to place more 
emphasis on factual recall in their assessments can refer to 
the presentation slides (Supporting Files S1 and S4. Seafood 
Traceability âÃÃ¬ Day 1 and Day 2 Presentation Slides) for content. 
For example, they could ask students to provide a definition 
for sustainability that goes beyond the traditional biological or 
ecological considerations. Instructors can also draw from Day 
2âÃÃ´s presentation on science and technological innovations as a 
source of assessment questions. Depending on the instructorsâÃÃ´ 
preferred style, these can be short-answer (e.g., Explain how 
integrated ecosystem research, which has emerged as the new 
gold standard for conducting fisheries studies, is different from 
traditional methods) or multiple-choice (e.g., Which of the 
following technologies, made famous by Bitcoin and other 
cryptocurrencies, are being pioneered as a decentralized 
and secure method for tracing seafood? Answer: blockchain 
electronic reporting). For a more policy-focused assessment, 
instructors could have students elaborate on the three 
principles for ensuring that science and technology guides 
policy and decision-making effectively (Supporting Files S4.

Students will:
âÃ³Ã¤ 
understand how to integrate a variety of scientific sources to create 
a toxicological assessment of a particular toxicant.
âÃ³Ã¤ 
condense scientific information for a generalist scientist audience 
with little expertise in a content area.
âÃ³Ã¤ 
value feedback and use it to enhance the quality of scientific writing.
âÃ³Ã¤ 
understand how scientific profiles of toxicants are generated from 
incomplete information and identify the gaps in knowledge.
âÃ³Ã¤ 
From the Toxicology Learning Framework at CourseSource, students 
will answer the following questions:
Â¬Âª
How do cells respond to exposure to toxicants?
Â¬Âª
How are organs affected by exposure to toxicants?
Â¬Âª
How are body systems affected by exposure to toxicants?
Â¬Âª
How do toxicants move through the environment to affect 
ecosystems?
Â¬Âª
How is the science of toxicology applied to government 
regulations to ensure the protection of individuals and the 
environment?

Learning Objectives
Students will be able to:
âÃ³Ã¤ 
employ scientific writing to explain scientific concepts, supported 
by the scientific literature, to a generalist scientific audience.
âÃ³Ã¤ 
describe the mechanism of action of a toxicant at the cellular, 
organs, body system, individual, and ecological system levels.
âÃ³Ã¤ 
evaluate pharmacokinetics/toxicokinetics for a toxicant, including 
administration, distribution, metabolism, and elimination (ADME).
âÃ³Ã¤ 
synthesize current government regulatory information for their 
toxicant, including allowable exposure limits from a variety of 
government organizations.
âÃ³Ã¤ 
define the impact of a toxicant on ecosystems.",,"Active Learning
Students are actively engaged in applying content covered in 
the classroom to a particular toxicant that they were assigned 
to at the beginning of the semester. After covering a given 
content area in the classroom, students search for authoritative 
sources applying that content area to their assigned toxicant. 
For example, after learning about ecological toxicology, the 
students would search for studies related to their particular 
toxicant being an environmental toxicant. The writing output 
is generally short, 2âÃÃ¬4 paragraphs, and accomplishable in no 
more than three hours of research. Peer review is performed in 
an online discussion board format with a pre-assigned group 
of 3âÃÃ¬4 students. Following peer review, students edit their own 
work, reflecting on the quality of their research and sources as 
well as lessons learned from their peers. This type of scaffolded 
approach improves writing communication competency and 
synthesis of material from the primary scientific literature and 
government resources (12).","Most of this is independent work.  I agree that there is agency since students can pick, but barring peer review, I am not convinced that this is ""active learning"".  Perhaps a ""bad"" exemplar?",Formative assessment; Paper / report / problem set,,"Assessment

The initial activity was developed by a faculty team at a 
National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine 
Scientific Teaching AllianceâÃÃ´s Northstar Summer Institute

neurobiology course at the University of Cincinnati in fall 
2015. In spring 2017, parts of the activity were modified 
as a pseudo-demonstration involving a few students in the 
neurobiology course. 
The Lesson was designed for a one-semester upper-
level Neurobiology course in the Department of Biological 
Sciences at the University of Cincinnati. Neurobiology is a 
lecture course that requires General Biology, General Biology 
Lab (2 semesters of each), Genetics, and Cell Biology as pre-
requisites. Most students have also had general and organic 
chemistry. The Lesson was done in the 8 week of the 14-
week semester and students had done reading, taken quizzes 
and one exam, and been involved in group and face-to face 
classroom activities on the following topics: organization of 
the nervous system, neural circuits and signaling, including 
resting membrane potential, action potential, and synaptic 
potentials, ion channels and transporters, synaptic integration, 
and a survey of neurotransmitters and their receptors. The 62 
students were a mix of junior and senior biological sciences 
majors. At the beginning of the semester, groups of four or five 
students were formed such that each group contained some 
confident and some less confident students based on a survey 
given before the first class. Students generally sat with their 
group in lecture and did some group activities each week. The 
Leaky Neuron activity was done in these same groups in an 
undergraduate lab setting with running water and sinks that 
were available at the class time.""

The first consists of matching restriction endonuclease digest protocols with images obtained from stained agarose gels. Students are given the sequence of six plasmid cDNAs, characteristics of the plasmid vector, and the endonuclease digest protocols, which specify the enzyme(s) used. Students calculate the expected lengths of digestion products using this information and free tools available on the web. Students learn how to read gels and then match their predicted fragment lengths to the digital images obtained from the gel electrophoresis of the cDNA digest. In the PCR experiment, students are given six cDNA sequences and six sets of primers. By querying NCBI BLAST, students can match the PCR fragments to the lengths of the predicted in silico PCR products. The ruse posed to students is that the gels were inadvertently mislabeled during processing. Although students know the experimental details, they do not know which gel goes with a given restriction endonuclease digest or PCRÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂthey must deduce the answers. Because the gel images are from actual studentsÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ experiments, the data sometimes result from mishandling/mislabeling or faulty protocol execution.

At first blush, this task may seem relatively simple once

The challenge comes because the 
protocols were not always followed faithfully (Figure 1). 
Students are not only challenged to figure out which gel 
goes with which protocol, but also are challenged to 
provide explanations for unexpected outcomes when they 
are present. The gel images come from UCLA studentsâÃÃ´

In addition to engaging multiple types of students, the cystic 
fibrosis case study emphasizes diversity of genetic variation 
in genomic medicine. The prevalence of cystic fibrosis varies 
among different populations (1 in 3,500 in Caucasian Americans, 
1 in 17,000 in African Americans, and 1 in 31,000 in Asian 
Americans) (8). Studies have shown that there are 1,700+ genetic 
variations that have been associated with cystic fibrosis, all with 
varying allele frequencies. Historically, the studies that classified 
these variant types were heavily skewed towards studies that 
focused on Caucasian populations. However, recent studies have 
shown that the frequency of these variants in non-Caucasian 
populations is variable (9). Furthermore, novel variants that 
are not present in Caucasian populations have been identified 
in non-Caucasian cystic fibrosis patients. Despite these recent 
findings, screening panels designed to test for cystic fibrosis 
variants are largely based upon the variants identified from 
the original studies of Caucasian populations (10). This lesson 
engages students in a discussion on the implications of study bias 
in medical research through an examination of the frequency 
of these variants in non-Caucasian populations.",,,Yes,,Yes,,"

Out-of-Class Assignment
Students will complete the remainder of this assignment 
outside of class. Students are given 2-3 weeks (depending on 
the length of the course) to complete the assignment outside of 
class. Part 1 of the assignment is to illustrate and label the central 
dogma by drawing the initiation, elongation, and termination 
steps of DNA replication, transcription, and translation. Each 
step and molecular component should be labeled clearly. A color 
coded key is the most commonly used method of labeling. Each 
step should be accompanied by a brief explanation of the step.
Part 3 of the assignment is to research the CFTR genetic variant 
class identified during the in-class portion of the lesson. The 
student should prepare a Â¬Î© page to 1 page report describing 
the effect that the genetic variant has on the CFTR protein and 
describe what medications have been developed to target this 
class of variants. Emphasis should be placed on the role of 
pharmacogenomics in the report. This exercise can be tailored 
to the level of the class to increase or decrease the difficulty as 
the instructor sees fit. This lesson can also be extended to include 
a comparison of allele frequencies among populations listed in 
the gnomAD databases to the allele frequencies listed in Table 
3 for advanced classes. Likewise, advanced students may also 
wish to use the ClinVar database to assess the clinical evidence 
for pathogenicity for their variant. The gnomAD database is a 
resource of aggregated sequencing data from control samples 
from large genomic sequencing studies (11). Conversely, ClinVar 
is a repository of genomic variation identified in clinical patient 
samples (12). ClinVar and gnomAD accession numbers for each

small groups and discussing why species

distribution pat-
terns may differ for different species and in different ecosys-
tems. In addition, they should discuss how biodiversity can
be effectively sampled for and how habitat loss is likely to
affect biodiversity in different ecosystems. Depending on the
nature and level of the class, this activity can be either student
or instructor led. To help facilitate this discussion, I have cre-
ated a glossary of important terminology that can be examined
by students (Appendix).
3. Using the discussion above, the list of materials that stu-
dents have been given ahead of time, and the terms in the
Appendix, students will work with instructors to design a
study using jelly beans that can be distributed across a
landscape in different ways to simulate the distribution
of biodiversity across space. Specific considerations to
make are what types of distribution patterns jelly beans
will be placed in and what types of species these jelly
beans will simulate.
4. Using the approach designed above, students will disperse
variety packs of jelly beans across a study area to simulate
how 
""
species
"" 
are distributed across a landscape. Flavors
of jelly beans represent different 
""
species,
"" 
so keep the
jelly-bean packages to use as 
""
species identification guides.
""
How jelly beans are distributed across the study area can be
determined in conjunction with students or to suit the pur-
pose of the lesson (e.g., examining the differences between
random, regular, and clumped distribution patterns).
5. Using the background readings described above, students and
instructors can design an effective sampling methodology fo

determining how species are distributed across their habitat.
The most simplistic approach for this is to have student groups
establish a transect line that goes through the area where the
jelly beans are distributed (Figure 1). This will create a subsec-
tion of habitat, which can be sampled to determine the number
of 
""
species
"" 
and their abundance.
6. Following the placement of transects, students can utilize a
quadrat sampling method of their choice to sample for
""
biodiversity

(i.e., count the number and type of jelly
beans they find). Two simple approaches for students are
to place a PVC quadrat or hula hoop at set or random inter-

The assignment described in this paper represented roughly 20% of the course grade in an undergraduate introductory ecology course.

The first two objectives relate to the groupâÃÃ´s creation of the product, and the last objective addresses the studentsâÃÃ´ engagement in the follow-up activity in which they worked to solve one
anotherâÃÃ´s rooms.

Upon completion of the assignment, students should be
able to complete the following.
1. Create a themed ""room"" filled with ecology-based riddles and puzzles that represents a novel virtual escape room for their peers based on an important ecological topic.
2. Summarize and synthesize primary literature into clues and locks to educate their peers about an ecological topic.
3. Use critical thinking and discussion of ecological topics with peers to solve their peersâÃÃ´ escape rooms.

Overall, the goal of this assignment was to replace a field-based group research project which usually comprised a bulk of the laboratory effort in years when the class was in person. To minimize safety concerns associated with COVID, the majority of the lab in spring 2021 was shifted online, and this assignment further provided opportunities for students to collaborate virtually. We aimed for the assignment to allow students to immerse themselves in the literature on a chosen topic, deeply explore concepts related to their topic, and develop a creative and informative virtual escape room. The first two objectives are measurable tasks whose products were assessed with the scoring rubric at the end of the semester. For the third objective, we did not intend to measure a studentâÃÃ´s critical thinking; rather, we sought for students to practice critical thinking skills during the activity (i.e., using data and evidence to make decisions), which was assessed through the scoring rubric and peer reviews. To maintain the scholarly dissemination endpoint that students generally enjoy about long-term research projects, the final piece of the assignment was for each group to share their escape room on the final day of the semester so that their peers could learn about other topics using critical and creative thinking to ""escape"" each otherâÃÃ´s rooms.""",,"As a group, stu-
dents selected an ecology topic among a set of about 15 in-
structor-created topics which aligned with ecological concepts
discussed throughout the semester. The second lab of the semester was dedicated to scaffold-
ing literature searching, discriminating between popular and
scientific articles, and developing skills on how to effectively
read scientific papers.  In the 4th week of a 16-
week semester, students participated in an instructor-led lab
which allowed them to experience an example escape room
and familiarize themselves with how to independently build an
escape room.
For the final escape room submission, students were required
to email a preview link of their main slide (i.e., a link that allows a
participant to view the main slide not as a slideshow but as an
active presentation) and an answer key for all their locks to the
teaching assistant. The links were compiled into a shared Google
spreadsheet and shared with the class on the final day of class.

pathways and are governed by the laws of thermodynamics), and
systems (i.e., living systems are interconnected and interacting).

We describe the curriculum for an innovative, course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE) appropriate for a large, introductory cell and molecular biology laboratory class that leverages students' high level of interest in cancer. The course is highly collaborative and emphasizes the analysis and interpretation of original scientific data. During the course, students work in teams to characterize a collection of mutations in the human p53 tumor suppressor gene via expression and analysis in yeast. Initially, student pairs use both qualitative and quantitative assays to assess the ability of their p53 mutant to activate expression of reporter genes, and they localize their mutation within the p53 structure. Through facilitated discussion, students suggest possible molecular explanations for the transactivation defects displayed by their p53 mutants and propose experiments to test these hypotheses that they execute during the second part of the course. They use a western blot to determine whether mutant p53 levels are reduced, a DNA-binding assay to test whether recognition of any of three p53 target sequences is compromised, and fluorescence microscopy to assay nuclear localization. Students studying the same p53 mutant periodically convene to discuss and interpret their combined data. The course culminates in a poster session during which students present their findings to peers, instructors, and the greater biosciences community.

Students conduct 5-10 simulations each of which lasts about 45 seconds.

âÃ³Ã¤ 
How is genetic information expressed so it affects an organismâÃÃ´s 

structure and function?

âÃ³Ã¤ 
How do different types of mutations affect genes and the 

corresponding mRNAs and proteins?

âÃ³Ã¤ 
How does genetics impact society and society impact genetics?

Learning Objectives

Students will be able to:

âÃ³Ã¤ 
explain how DNA mutations affect protein function and phenotype.

âÃ³Ã¤ 
predict the relative phenotypic consequences of different types of 

mutations.

âÃ³Ã¤ 
explain why ""similar"" mutations in the same gene lead to different 

phenotypes, and why mutations in different genes lead to similar 

phenotypes.",,"Case studies are an excellent way to develop critical thinking 
and promote active learning (8, 9). They are especially relevant 
for science students seeking a career in health or medicine in 
which they will interact directly with patients. In this lesson, 
students independently read and/or listen to a fascinating case 
study of a citizen scientist researching her own disease. They 
then consider questions related to the reading. We tested this 
lesson as a homework assignment (2017, 2019) as well as part of 
a flipped classroom: students performed the background reading 
and listening as homework, and worked through the worksheet 
(S1. Phenotypic effects of mutation - Worksheet) in class in small 
groups (2021). The questions can also be adapted for in-class 
clicker questions. We suggest using the ethical questions at the 
end of the worksheet for a short in-class debate.",,Worksheet,,"Our goal was to emphasize that: 1) The same phenotype 
can result from mutations in different genes; 2) Mutations in 
the same gene can lead to different phenotypes. The worksheet 
supplied with the current lesson (S1. Phenotypic effects of 
mutation - Worksheet) involves short answer questions that are 
each assigned a suggested point value (3-6 pts) for a total of 50 
points. Because our classes were relatively small, we were able 
to consider each answer and therefore awarded partial credit for 
partially correct answers. We have also included several ""extra 
credit"" questions that involve ethical considerations rather than 
""correct"" or ""incorrect"" answers, and so we awarded extra credit 
points simply for well thought out answers. The point system is 
flexible and the instructor can choose to evaluate however they 
believe is appropriate. The questions are currently formatted as 
short answer, but most may be converted to multiple choice. In 
addition, choosing to flip the lesson so that students complete the 
worksheet in-class or use the questions as the foundation for an 
in-class discussion negates the need for worksheet grading (S2. 
Phenotypic effects of mutation - Worksheet Key), and teachers 
can instead assess students based on participation.",,Yes,"Cited as supplemental materials, supporting materials, or in an appendix",,Neutral,

It appeared clear that amphibian ectoderm was pre-programmed to form epidermis, and that the neural phenotype was induced by a chemical signal from mesoderm. The ""ectoderm makes skin, unless induced to make nervous system"" model appeared in many textbooks. This interpretation, however, was not simply incorrect but 180 degrees out of alignment with the actual situation. As subsequently demonstrated, the default state of amphibian ectoderm is neuronal, and the expression of the epidermal phenotype requires cell signaling (Hemmati-Brivanlou and Melton, 1992; 1994; 1997). In this activity, students are presented with key experiments in a stepwise fashion. At several points, they work in groups to devise models that explain particular experimental results. The stepwise presentation of results mirrors the history of discoveries in this experimental system. Eventually, faced with seemingly contradictory data, students must revise their models substantially and in doing so, experience the paradigm shift. The lesson also examines the history of this paradigm shift. Data inconsistent with the ""epidermal default"" model were published years before the ""neural default"" model was proposed, but the significance of the surprising new data was underemphasized by the scientists who made the discovery. Discussing this situation provides insight into how science works and highlights the possibility that working scientists may become entrenched in prevailing paradigms. Such ""nature of science"" discussions emphasize research as a human activity, and help to dispel student misconceptions about science and scientists.",677,Hoskins 2008,City University of New York,,City University of New York,"

work in groups to devise models that explain particular 
experimental results. The stepwise presentation of results 
mirrors the history of discoveries 
in this experimental

doing so, experience the paradigm shift. 
 
The lesson also examines the history of this paradigm 
shift. Data inconsistent with the ""epidermal default"" model 
were published years before the ""neural default"" model 
was proposed, but the significance of the surprising new 
data was underemphasized by the scientists who made the 
discovery. Discussing this situation provides insight into 
how science works and highlights the possibility that 
working scientists may become entrenched in prevailing 
paradigms.

Learning objectives 1-3 are modified from those of Michael et al. (1)",,"""Role-playing simulations can be particularly effective at 
modelling dynamic physiologic processes, including muscle 
contraction (4), ventilation (5), protein synthesis (6), and the 
immune response (7). Experiential learning theory supports 
the use of this activity type, since it involves multiple learning 
environments (thinking, feeling, behaving (doing), and 
perceiving) (Kolb & Kolb, 2008). Role-plays are also highly 
motivating and they can provide immediate feedback (8). This 
activity uses student volunteers to act as the hypothalamus, 
anterior pituitary gland, and target gland, with the number 
of noises from different musical instruments representing the 
output of each gland. For each of the situations outlined in 
Table 1, students worked together to identify the perturbation 
(which instrument would ""go first""), and then how the other 
instruments would modify their output as a result (see Supporting 
File S2. Musical Feedback âÃÃ¬ Student Handout). By subsequently 
applying the role play (and thus the underlying core concept) to 
different hormonal axes and under different situations, students 
construct knowledge by synthesizing new information with 
information that has already been learned. The activity provides 
opportunities to address numerous misconceptions targeted 
by the homeostasis conceptual framework (9). For instance, if 
students ceased making noises after homeostasis was restored, 
the instructor can mention that feedback mechanisms function 
even when the system is in balance (in other words, the music 
never stops). Other common misconceptions and errors are 
described in the Lesson Plan.""",,Formative assessment; Exam; Quiz,,"""The 2015 cohort completed a 4-question paper quiz after 
the mini-lecture based on the Homeostasis Concept Inventory,

that feedback loops only function when there is a problem, 
(2) how the negative feedback loop restores hormone levels 
following a transient perturbation, (3) how the system adapts to 
a hormone deficiency, and (4) how the system adapts to a tumor. 
The simulation was then used to model the latter three situations 
but was not used to explicitly examine the first misconception in 
either 2013 or 2015. Students completed a paper version of the 
post-test, which contained identical (question 1) or isomorphic

To help overcome these obstacles, the Department of Biology at James Madison University (JMU) has developed a cost-effective, scalable, and transferable semester-long (14-week) course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE) designed for large enrollment introductory biology labs. In this series of labs, first-year students use DNA barcoding to engage in authentic research practices drawn from the fields of ecology, molecular biology, and bioinformatics. These labs enable students to identify local species of plants, fungi, and invertebrates using student-generated DNA barcode sequences, which are then shared through a public database. Since their implementation at JMU in 2016, students in these labs have created and shared over 1,500 unique DNA barcode sequences and documented over 300 local species of plants, fungi, and invertebrates. These data are being used in an ongoing project comparing the biodiversity of forest edge versus forest interior habitats, but the labs are adaptable to almost any habitat or taxonomic group. In this article, we provide detailed descriptions of the content, logistics, and implementation of this 14-week series of labs.

inclusive learning environment in multiple ways. First, as the 
gateway introductory biology course required for all biology 
majors and some other programs, all our biology students 
have equal access to an authentic research experience early 
in their academic career. Second, the term-long barcoding 
project is centered on exploring the natural diversity of the 
JMU Arboretum. These sorts of natural habitats can often be 
unfamiliar to students, so we make great efforts to make them 
accessible to all students regardless of their familiarity or 
comfort with nature. Thus, these labs provide an opportunity 
for all students to learn about the organisms and habitats in 
their own proverbial backyard. Furthermore, students are 
free to select the organism they investigate, which supports 
student comfort, creative autonomy, and project ownership. 
Likewise, the data students generate are added to an open-
access species database that other researchers, arboretum 
staff, and the general public can use for research, outreach, 
learning natural history, or conservation purposes. Open 
access to these student-generated data not only enhances the 
inclusivity of these labs, but also has the potential to increase 
the meaningfulness of these labs for both students and non-
student users. For example, data generated by students at 
JMU have been used in faculty research to identify unique or 
hard to identify species of beetles and beetle larvae. Students 
have also contributed data for fungal surveys conducted by 
the Mycological Society of America. Furthermore, students 
are free to select an organism of interest to investigate, which 
supports creative autonomy and project ownership. Third, as 
referenced above as a design framework feature, the field and 
lab activities are collaborative and require effective teamwork 
inside and outside of the classroom for the successful 
completion of tasks. Fourth, varying modalities of instruction 
incorporated into the lessons such as hands-on tasks, online 
modules, mini-lectures, discussions, and demonstrations, 
accommodate student preferences in learning. Similarly, as 
described above, varying forms of formative and summative assessments are used to measure student learning trajectories 
and guide instruction. As possible, assignments are criterion-
scored using standardized rubrics made available in advance 
to make student expectations explicit (e.g. Supporting File

broader course design, we 
integrated the five essential 
dimensions for a CURE as identified by Auchincloss and others 
(20). This framework involves the meaningful engagement 
of students in: 1: Multiple scientific practices that reflect 
activities comparable to the community of practice, such as 
asking questions, using various tools of science, gathering and 
analyzing data, navigating the messiness of real-world data, 
and communication. 2: Discovery through a novel research 
question or problem that may advance our understanding 
of the natural world. 3: Research that is relevant beyond the 
scope of the course with the potential of furthering scientific 
knowledge. 4: Collaborative in terms of student-student and 
student-instructor interactions for problem solving. 5: Iterative 
by providing opportunities for trying, failing, and trying again, 
which is central to the learning process as well as personal 
development (21). In addition, drawing from literature on 
apprentice-like undergraduate research (e.g., 22-23), emphasis 
was placed on providing multiple opportunities for 6: scientific 
communication in oral and written formats to contribute to the 
progression of research-related and life-long skills.
Given the nature of the design framework and associated 
course activities, students are inherently engaged as active 
learners. The described lessons encourage student autonomy 
as they navigate a wide variety of hands- and minds-on 
activities in the laboratory and in the field. Students work 
both individually and collaboratively over the term as they 
gain exposure to the disciplinary knowledge and research-
skills necessary to successfully complete the DNA barcoding 
project as well as the broader nature of the process of science. 
For this, the lessons are designed with minimal lecturing and scaffolded to help students progressively advance their 
understanding and skills with the instructor taking the role 
of a lab mentor, providing enough guidance to keep students 
on track, while maintaining distance that promotes autonomy

Student success can be measured by the completion of steps throughout the lab and the quality of answers/inferences made at the end (i.e., their interpretation of results and how they connect them to the overarching question). Student success can also be measured by comparing answers to the pre-module and post-module questions. By the end of this module, students should:

-Activity A: demonstrate understanding of the difference between species richness, abundance, and evenness by answering questions in the PowerPoint or posed by the instructor during class discussion or written work. Students should also show basic graphing abilities in RStudio by generating a bar graph.
-Activity B - Part 1: show an understanding of how species richness, abundance, and evenness are incorporated in biodiversity indices and similarity coefficients by calculating them for karstic wetland sites. Students should be able to make these calculations in RStudio and interpret/compare results about these sites/regions.
-Activity B - Part 2: exhibit the ability to use rarefaction curves as a different technique for interpreting species richness by generating a graphic in RStudio and answering PowerPoint/instructor's questions during class discussion or written work.
-Activity C: demonstrate individual skill level at applying techniques and concepts learned in activity A-B to answer the overarching questions ('are these karstic wetland sites considered diverse and are there dominant periphytic diatom species in karstic wetland communities?').""",,Yes,"Cited as supplemental materials, supporting materials, or in an appendix",,Neutral,

Recent research has suggested that active learning strategies, a focus on science as process, and directly addressing misconceptions can improve studentsÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ understanding of evolution. This paper describes an innovative, inquiry-based laboratory curriculum for introductory biological anthropology employing these strategies that was implemented at West Chester University (WCU) in 2013ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ2016. The key objectives were to help students understand how biological anthropologists think about and explore problems using scientific approaches and to improve student understanding of evolution. Lab activities centered on scenarios that challenged students to solve problems using the scientific method in a process of guided inquiry. Some of these activities involved application of DNA techniques. Formative and summative learning assessments were implemented to measure progress toward the objectives. One of these, a pre- and post-course evolution concepts survey, was administered at WCU (both before and after the implementation of the new curriculum) and at three other universities with more standard introductory biological anthropology curricula. Evolution survey results showed greater improvement in understanding from pre- to post-course scores for WCU students compared with students at the comparison universities (p <.001). WCU students who took the inquiry-based curriculum also had better understanding of evolution at the post-course period than WCU students who took the course prior to implementation of the new curriculum (p <.05). In-class clicker assessments demonstrated improved understanding of evolution concepts (p <.001) and scientific method (p <.05) over the course of individual labs. Two labs that involved applying DNA methods received the highest percentage ratings by students as ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂvery usefulÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ to understanding important concepts of evolution and human variation. WCU student ratings of their confidence in using the scientific method showed greater improvement pre- to post-course during the study period as compared with the earlier, pre-implementation period (p <.05). The student-centered biological anthropology laboratory curriculum developed at WCU is more effective at helping students to understand general and specific concepts about evolution than are more traditional curricula. This appears to be directly related to the inquiry-based approach used in the labs, the emphasis on knowledge and practice of scientific method, directly addressing misconceptions about evolution, and a structure that involves continual reinforcement of correct concepts about evolution and human variation over the semester.

Bacteriophages are viruses that infect bacteria and are either virulent or temperate; virulent phages can only undergo the lytic cycle, which results in death of the host cell, while temperate phages can undergo either the lytic or lysogenic cycle, the latter of which results in the long-term association between host and virus. Bacteriophages significantly affect bacterial population in nature and are even attractive therapeutic interventions for some bacterial infections in humans. Therefore, this lesson was designed to educate students about the structure and function of bacteriophages and how viral infections can impact bacterial populations. The learning goals of this lesson are to understand how the lytic and lysogenic cycles of bacteriophages vary, affect bacterial growth, and are dictated by their unique genomes. To this end, the lesson incorporates a homework assignment for students before class, a series of in-class activities and critical thinking scenarios, and a homework assignment after class.

learning process. Thus, the lesson includes several strategies, 
including think-pair-share, small group discussions, and a strip 
sequence, which allows for students who favor different learning 
approaches to engage with the concepts and topics. At the 
beginning of class, instructors can explicitly state to the class 
that the intention of the varied learning strategies is to promote 
an equitable and accessible classroom for all students (15). This 
promotes inclusive learning as students feel less targeted during 
random call or when students are asked to contribute during 
class discussion. I have found that a high level of transparency 
in my teaching approaches is well received by students and it 
encourages students who are more accustomed to traditional 
lecture classes open up to active learning styles. Though there 
is a short lecture within this lesson, it is designed to be concise 
and engaging as intellectual engagement is minimally elicited 
during traditional in-class lectures (16).
Students work together in small groups multiple times during 
this lesson as it cultivates social learning and peer education. 
As small groups have been shown to support learning gains (17) 
and support students of various disciplines and levels (18,19), 
they are heavily utilized in my classes to create a more inclusive 
and inviting environment. The groups are intentionally assigned 
by the instructor to promote inclusivity and allow for students 
of varying achievement levels to collaborate and learn from one 
another. This lesson employs think-pair-share, which allows for 
more meaningful class discussions as students take the time to 
critically think about a topic and exchange ideas with classmates 
before whole class discussion. Further, students write down 
their thoughts before class discussion, which eases anxieties for 
students who are uncomfortable with public speaking.
The use of technology is generally promoted in this course 
as assignments can be completed and submitted online, thus 
decreasing the environmental burdens associated with paper. 
However, as some students may not have a laptop or other 
classroom-friendly internet-connected device, instructors should 
print out a few copies of the assignments to accommodate all 
students. Students can submit their final work by emailing the 
instructor a photo of their completed assignment.""",,,Yes,,Yes,,"Learning Goals

engage in learning the concepts, including random call, a short 
interactive lecture, groupwork, think-pair-share, whole class 
discussion, and small group discussion.
Before class, students actively engage in a timed homework 
assignment to prepare for class (S1. Lytic and lysogenic âÃÃ¬ 
Bacteriophages in Medicine Pre-Class Homework Assignment). 
In class, students initially work in pairs to label the parts of 
a bacteriophage (S2a. Lytic and lysogenic âÃÃ¬ Bacteriophage 
Replication Cycles In-Class Worksheet Section 1). Subsequently, 
the instructor facilitates a short and interactive lecture (S3. 
Lytic and lysogenic âÃÃ¬ In-Class Lecture); the interactive portion 
is mediated by critical thinking questions posed to the class, 
which should elicit whole class discussion. At the end of the 
lecture, students split into small groups and each group works 
together to complete a strip sequence activity (S4. Lytic and 
lysogenic âÃÃ¬ In-Class Strip Sequence). During this activity, each 
group competes against one another to accurately complete 
a puzzle that links together the lytic and lysogenic cycles. 
The competition is not timed, but the first group to accurately 
complete the puzzle could win a prize, should the instructor 
choose to distribute one.
The next activity in the lesson utilizes think-pair-share to solve 
critical thinking problems. Think-pair-share is a collaborative 
learning technique that requires students to individually think 
about a topic (think), share their ideas with a partner (pair), 
and finally discuss their insights with the class (share) (12,13). 
For the remainder of class, students work in small groups to 
apply their knowledge and interpret graphical representations 
of data (S2d. Lytic and lysogenic âÃÃ¬ Bacteriophage Replication 
Cycles In-Class Worksheet Section 4). The use of random call throughout the lesson is suggested as it has been shown to 
improve the participation gap between genders in a classroom 
setting (14). To avoid feelings of anxiety among students during 
random call, it is recommended that the instructor lead students 
to the correct answer by asking a series of simpler questions. 
Further, if students give an inaccurate response, instructors 
should thank students for bringing up an important opportunity 
for clarification. By doing so, students are likely to be more 
comfortable in a learning environment that welcomes active 
participation, even when students give the wrong answers.""",,Formative assessment; Worksheet; Other,discussions,"""Students complete the multiple-choice homework assignment 
(S1. Lytic and lysogenic âÃÃ¬ Bacteriophages in Medicine Pre-
Class Homework Assignment) and receive their grades before 
class. In class, students have many opportunities for self-
evaluation as the problems within the lesson are intermittently 
reviewed. Discussions within small groups provide students 
with opportunities for formative self-assessment. Formative 
assessment by the instructor occurs via interaction with each 
small group and the large class discussion. The instructor should 
circulate the room to be available for questions and to provide 
immediate feedback where required. Depending on class size, 
the instructor should ensure that sufficient time is allocated 
for interaction with each group. If possible, assistance from a 
teaching assistant would be helpful in cases of large class sizes.
For summative assessment, instructors should read the answers 
for all sections of the in-class and post-class worksheets to ensure 
that each student has met the learning objectives. Section 1 of 
the in-class worksheet (S2a. Lytic and lysogenic âÃÃ¬ Bacteriophage 
Replication Cycles In-Class Worksheet Section 1) addresses the 
learning goal ""label key parts of a bacteriophage"". During the 
strip sequence activity, students will arrange steps of the lytic and 
lysogenic viral infections by bacteriophage. The learning goals 
""compare and contrast replication cycles of T4 and lambda"", 
""predict replication cycle of virus based on the genes it carries"", 
and ""interpret and analyze graphical representations of qPCR 
and plaque assay data"" are addressed in Sections 2, 3, and 4 of 
the in-class worksheet, respectively. Finally, the learning goal 
""compare and contrast the differences between lysogenic and 
latent viral infections"" is addressed in the post-class worksheet 
(S5. Lytic and lysogenic âÃÃ¬ Post-class Homework Assignment). 
Sufficient feedback should be provided to students by the 
instructor on the post-class worksheet as the content is not 
discussed in a follow-up class, unless the instructor chooses to 
do so. In this course, students are given a participation grade, 
which is based on thoughtful contributions during discussions 
in class and active engagement in groupwork. Students who 
prefer to take more time to complete sections of the worksheet 
are welcome to submit them online up to 24 hours after the 
end of class.
Throughout the class period, students are prompted to 
submit completed sections of the assignment on the learning 
management system. This facilitates the grading process and 
is more likely to keep a uniform pace throughout the class 
despite different levels of student achievement. Each submitted 
section of the lesson is evaluated for accuracy and effort by the 
instructor after class.""",Instructor uses formative and summative terms in unusual way.,Yes,"Cited as supplemental materials, supporting materials, or in an appendix",,Neutral,

self-paced homework assignment and groupwork during class 
time. The group work strategies used in the lesson included 
think-pair-share, collaborative experimental design, whole 
class discussion, jigsaw, and poster session.
Prior to class, students complete a homework assignment 
that introduces them to how the immune system responds to 
influenza. The homework engages all students through a video 
that introduces the immune system and ties in concepts that 
were previously addressed in the course, such as inflammation. 
This exercise, therefore, not only introduces new concepts 
that are expanded upon in class, but also builds on previous 
knowledge. The homework assignment also 
introduces 
vaccines and the length of time that is needed to develop 
them. Students are asked to think about why it often takes 
more than a decade to develop and manufacture a vaccine, 
which is an especially relevant topic amid the development of 
a SARS-CoV2 vaccine.
In class, we review concepts from the homework assignment. 
This check-in ensures that studentsâÃÃ´ questions are answered 
and helps students who did not complete the homework 
learn the basics that set the stage for the next activity. This 
is a whole class discussion facilitated with random call. We 
use random call because it provides instructors with a more 
accurate perception of class-wide knowledge 
retention 
and understanding. Further, as females tend to voice their 
opinions less frequently in class than their male counterparts 
in undergraduate biology courses, we use random call to 
equalize classroom participation (20).
Next, we implemented another inclusive strategy, think-
pair-share. Here, students first work independently to draw a 
model to relate different principles that were covered in their 
homework assignment and from previous classes, specifically

response to 
influenza, homeostasis, antibodies, hormones, age, and vaccines. Students compare 
their models to those of their neighbors and discuss the 
differences that exist between them. Lastly, students share 
any notable differences between their models as a class. 
We utilized think-pair-share in this activity to allow students 
to think critically about concepts that were previously 
introduced and express their thoughts with peers to promote 
social learning.
We then transitioned into groupwork for the majority of 
class time. A jigsaw is a cooperative learning technique in 
which students are assigned into groups and the assignment is 
broken into pieces that must be assembled by the groups for 
a complete understanding (21,22). We used this technique to 
illustrate a collaborative research environment that is driven by 
teamwork. The class divides into four groups with four students 
in each group based on the number designation on their 
worksheets. For example, one group would have 4 students with 
worksheets designated ""A1"", ""B1"", ""C1"", and ""D1"". In these 
small groups, students work together to develop a hypothesis 
based on content covered in the homework assignment. The 
instructor randomly selects a representative from each group 
to articulate the teamâÃÃ´s hypothesis. Subsequently, students 
design experiments to test the hypothesis and review primary 
data. This exercise allows students to develop skills aligned 
with core competencies of undergraduate biology, such as 
experimental design and data interpretation. During the final 
part of the jigsaw, the groups reshuffle such that all students 
with the same letter designation are in the same group, which 
allows one student from each expert group to disseminate 
student expertise. For example, a reshuffled group would have 
four students with worksheets designated ""A1"", ""A2"", ""A3"", 
and ""A4"". Students in the reshuffled groups describe and 
discuss their findings, which provides each student with the 
knowledge of each topic in the activity.
Finally, the expert groups reconvene and the 
lesson 
concludes with a ""poster session"" in which each group 
presents to the class in order to encourage peer discussion. 
This exercise allows students to creatively describe their 
experimental approach and present their efforts in a manner 
similar to a research conference. To ensure that students in the 
audience are engaged during this session, they are encouraged 
to ask questions and write down key aspects of the information 
that is shared, as outlined in Supporting File S3. Stress and 
Immune System âÃÃ¬ Influenza II In-Class Worksheet.""",,Formative assessment; Worksheet,,"""Each of the strategies discussed above in Scientific Teaching 
Themes: Active Learning 
represents an opportunity for 
formative assessment to measure studentsâÃÃ´ progress toward 
the learning goals. During class, students write answers to 
the questions on the worksheet during both the individual 
brainstorming session and the groupwork session. As we 
circulate through the classroom, we listen to conversations 
based on the worksheet questions and make comments 
about what we hear and what we read on the worksheet as 
necessary and provide immediate feedback to students. We 
assess learning and student equity within groups based on 
participation during the poster session.
For summative learning, the students submit the homework 
prior to class via the learning management system; we evaluate the assignment for accuracy, effort, and level of completion

Underutilized public datasets are often generated by community-based or citizen science projects to address conservation issues supported by local residents. The objectives of this course activity are for students to contribute to a community science project, observe local species diversity, develop biodiversity questions, and apply data science techniques. Engaging students in these local projects enhances their understanding of the scientific process and its broader impacts on their community. The City Nature Challenge (CNC) is an annual global community science event where students participate by documenting species observations with the iNaturalist application, similar to localized BioBlitz events. Students are guided through using the iNaturalist database to practice biodiversity calculations then data is collected through participation in CNC (or a BioBlitz event an instructor arranges for their class). Spreadsheet software is used by students to organize, analyze, and summarize their relevant data to their peers. Students join the iNaturalist community of observers, which includes professional and non-professional naturalists. Therefore, students can see the themselves as scientists by contributing locally relevant data to a global and digital community of scientists. Experience working with large datasets such as the CNC iNaturalist dataset is essential for STEM careers and building data literacy.

learning environment to a computer lab rather than requiring 
students to have personal computers already loaded with the 
required programs (a web browser and data management 
software such as MS Office Excel or Google Sheets). Contact 
the departmentâÃÃ´s instructional technology specialist for any 
recommendations for specific accommodations available in the 
computer labs. If personal computers are available or preferred, 
an internet connection and any program that manages data 
through spreadsheets will work to complete the lesson.
Access to a device that can take a photograph outside is a 
key component of this lesson. Ideally, a mobile device (such 
as a smartphone or tablet with satellite connection) with the 
iNaturalist application would be used. Accounts are free to create 
on iNaturalist. If mobile devices are prohibited or otherwise 
unavailable, observations may be made with digital cameras 
and uploaded through the iNaturalist website. Some colleges 
have cameras that can be loaned to the students, so it may be 
useful to check with departments whether these resources are 
available. The one important difference when using a digital 
camera to make observations is that students must record where 
they were when the photo was taken so that the observations 
can have associated geolocations (a process that is automatic 
with a mobile phone). A simplified data sheet can be created 
to encourage students to record this information while they 
are making observations (columns would include time of 
observation, photo file number, and location information). 
Students could also be encouraged to meet up with a partner for making the observations, which will reduce the burden for 
every student to have a device as well as promote collaboration 
and safety for work outside of class. Instructors can submit 
their studentsâÃÃ´ observations as a compiled effort to maintain 
student anonymity and fulfill the goal of contributing to a public 
biodiversity database.
Schools may have restrictions on what applications and data 
students are allowed to share with respect to their coursework. 
If there are concerns, particularly about location sharing, there 
are some alternatives that allow students to participate without 
revealing identifying information. For example, the instructor 
might choose to create a single class iNaturalist account with 
their email address; the account would then be controlled 
by the instructor, but all students would be granted access to 
contribute observations. Instructors should monitor the account 
and change passwords if improper behavior is observed. More 
information on this adjustment can be found in the iNaturalist 
TeacherâÃÃ´s Guide (26).
If possible, we encourage students to create their own accounts 
on iNaturalist so they may continue to be lifelong observers of 
nature and be more mindful of the natural world around them. 
Instructors should make no assessment-related comments on 
student observations within the iNaturalist platform, as that 
may be a violation of FERPA regulations. Students will always 
have the option of deleting their iNaturalist accounts (and all 
of the data they created) after the lesson is complete, if they 
choose to do so.
Utilizing data collected by local and global communities 
demonstrates to students the scale and scope of who participates 
and contributes to scientific data. Reciprocally, the studentsâÃÃ´ 
efforts to record their observations extends beyond the classroom 
and into the broader community that can learn from and use 
their data for other projects. This activity also illustrates cultural 
diversity across neighborhoods, as different communities may 
support or cultivate different habitat types or species that 
influence the local diversity. Students collect independent 
data where they are or want to go; thus, the data represents the 
local areas and communities that students identify most with, 
rather than just the typical parks or recreation areas. Overall, 
the students are provided the opportunity to experience how 
science is accomplished through diverse participants and how 
through their contributions of observations, they become a part 
of that community of scientists.""",,,No,,Yes,,"Learning Goals

discussion, I use a set of integrated culturally-responsive 
mentoring and teaching strategies for student-centered and 
place-based teaching (16,18,19,21). Dr. Geneva Gay defines 
culturally-responsive teaching as ""...using cultural knowledge, 
prior experiences, frames of references, and performance styles 
of ethnically diverse students to make learning encounters 
more relevant and effective for them. It teaches to and through 
the strengths of these students"" (18). The culturally-responsive 
mentoring and teaching approach applies Dr. Gregory CajeteâÃÃ´s 
concept of the creative process instructional model (16). Dr. Cajete mentions that ""In Native American cultures, science 
and art are complementary dimensions of the community 
mind. This subtle yet profound relationship becomes apparent 
only when one focuses upon the processes of thought as 
opposed to its end products. It is, therefore, my contention 
that one can use art to teach science, and science to teach art, 
and cultural philosophy to teach both"" (16). The creative cycle 
contains three steps: 1.) provide frame of reference for students; 
2.) utilize principles, themes, and classification approaches 
in both Native American and Western cultural science; and 
3.) integrate both Native American and Western scientific 
approaches. The cyclical flow allows for deeper understanding 
of a scientific process and broader perspective on a specific 
concept in science. Here, the creative process cycle starts 
by linking cultural relevance of a developmental process. 
As we explore and discuss the cross-cultural dimensions 
and ethics on congenital heart defects in the greater Yakima 
Valley, we link the affective learning dimensions and explore 
in-depth the process of the molecular and cellular process 
of developmental biology. For example, before 
I began 
discussions on Cre/LoxP and fate mapping experiments, I 
engaged students in a community classroom discussion on 
articles that highlight emerging incidences of congenital heart 
diseases in the homeland of Yakama Nation, as well as the 
greater Yakima Valley of Washington State. Upon reading 
these articles, students explored how topics discussed in heart 
development and Cre/LoxP research in zebrafish heart cell 
lineages are linked to providing future insights into congenital 
heart diseases. Once the importance of how investigating 
heart development is linked to the health of our community, 
we then began to discuss the molecular and cellular aspects of 
heart development and the function of Cre/LoxP technology in

The conceptual framework for understanding evolution relies on thinking clearly about evolutionary trees (phylogenetics) and how geological history influences biological processes and diversity. Central to a studentÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs comprehension of evolutionary research is an understanding of how scientists infer evolutionary relatedness and how they integrate geographic data. To address these concepts, we developed a series of lessons suitable for a typical introductory biology course in which students learn to infer phylogenies for the plant family, Crassulaceae. In the first part of the lesson, students develop phylogenetic hypotheses based on both morphology and DNA sequence data, use software (MEGA: Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis, FigTree) to infer a phylogeny, and compare trees constructed from the different data sources and statistical models. In the second part of the lesson, students use their phylogenies and additional software (RASP) to reconstruct the biogeographic history of Crassulaceae.

instruction of the related course material. After content 
introduction using didactic lectures, worksheets, group work, 
or a combination of the above based on instructor style and 
preference, students will complete a take-home quiz to be 
done individually. This take-home quiz contains a list of terms 
and matching definitions where students need to identify the 
associated term (Supporting File S1: Genes, Mutations and 
Cancer - Pre-class assignment and Supporting File S2: Genes, 
Mutations and Cancer -Pre-class assignment answer key). This 
quiz serves as a pre-assessment to evaluate whether students 
have gained the foundational knowledge and includes a list of 
terms that students will use to complete their concept maps.
In class activities:
During the first class meeting after covering the associated 
content and assignment of the take home quiz, instructors 
will first lead a group discussion of the terms and definitions 
covered on that assignment to ensure student familiarity with 
the relevant terms. Students then work in groups of 4-6 to 
generate a concept map using the terms on the take home quiz. 
After group concept maps are completed, students exchange 
concept maps with another group, evaluate its connections, 
and edit as they see fit. Finally, students are tasked to design 
potential therapies on the exchanged map using inhibiting and 
activating drugs.

All Biology and Biotechnology majors are required to take a two-course sequence junior year with the same instructor.  All Bioengineering majors can take the fall genetics course as an elective, but are required to take the spring semester Bioinformatics course. Students must be comfortable from previous lab courses with biotechnology and lab skills to perform next-gen library preparation. Students who have successfully performed PCR and other techniques with pipetting and heat treatment steps are well prepared for library preparation. Students are not expected to have any previous programming experience before this two class sequence.

In the Fall semester, students take ""Genes and Genomes"" lecture and lab. The lab meets for 2 hours once a week.

In the Spring semester, students take a required ""Bioinformatics"" lecture course which is taught as online 3 credit course. The first bioinformatics project is the completion of this CURE. For this first project, they will run applications through the browser-based Galaxy project and use a web-based application created by the instructor.

students write a formal materials and methods paper upon 
completion of the lesson. This assignment is written in the style 
of a publication quality materials and methods section and

then assess their learning using an open lab notebook lab

This strategy allows us to assess the studentâÃÃ´s knowledge on the 
subject and their ability to maintain a proper notebook. The 
practical portion of lab exam includes questions on general 
laboratory skills that students should gain from participating 
fully in the lesson.
This lesson is based on close collaboration between the 
faculty member/course instructor and the students, where 
instructors take an active role in helping students evaluate 
and verify their results. Our assessment methods do not assess 
studentâÃÃ´s laboratory success and leave it to instructors on how 
to evaluate student effort and getting the ""correct"" answer. 
Rather our assessment method is based upon whether students 
learn the theory and application of a skill. The open-endedness 
of this lesson makes it possible that students might not initially 
be successful in all phases of the procedure. To increase 
chances of student success we recommend students work in 
groups to ensure that individual students have backup samples 
if needed. In the event that an entire group is unsuccessful in a 
skill, instructors should adequately prepare back up samples. 
Note that Module 1 can be run concurrently with Modules 2-4 
if needed. Typically, an instructor with previous experience in 
molecular biology should be able to complete all procedures 
contained in this lesson within two weeks.

scientific communication. Each student prepares a lab report structured as an original research article to gain experience in 
writing a publication quality manuscript. Individual components of their reports are prepared throughout the semester and 
are followed with instructor- and peer-based draft edits. Finally, students are tasked with working as a team to deliver an oral 
presentation, which drives them to come to a consensus on the interpretation of their groupâÃÃ´s data. ",Several class/lab periods,,,Yes,"This course includes varied types of instruction (discussion, 
hands-on activities, open-ended inquiry, mini-lectures) and 
multiple modes of assessment as noted above, both of which 
are inclusive teaching strategies that provide students with a 
variety of ways to learn and demonstrate competence (22, 23). 
Numerous opportunities for low-stakes formative feedback are 
provided early on through drafts of written work and paper 
analyses (24). Furthermore, all assignment instructions are 
designed using principles of transparency shown to improve 
sense of belonging and success for students from marginalized 
backgrounds (25). In keeping with transparency practices, 
detailed rubrics and guidelines are provided for all assessments 
to ensure that students are aware of what is expected of them.
Additionally, the instructors serve as guides and research 
mentors rather than coming from a place as the absolute 
holders of knowledge and authority in the classroom. For 
example, students are empowered with the agency to make 
their own decisions about experiments, such as choosing 
which mutant strains to work with. Because analyses of primary 
journal articles and student-generated data take place through 
small-group discussion, peer instruction is emphasized over 
instructor-led lectures.
By 
its nature, this course makes a mentored research 
experience accessible to all enrolled students and enables 
participation in scientific inquiry, which together can help 
students develop a sense of belonging in science (13). All 
materials and resources for this course were provided by 
Duquesne University, granting equal access to learning and 
experimental procedures regardless of the background or need 
of our students. Adaptations to this protocol may be made 
to accommodate students with disabilities or students at an 
increased risk of infection from microorganisms. This course 
is taught under the context of microevolution and does not 
infringe on religious beliefs related to macroevolution. Finally, 
by discussing how diversity provides source material upon 
which natural selection can act, the course content fosters 
appreciation for the value of existing diversity in a population 
for the overall fitness of that species.",,,Yes,,Yes,,"Learning Goals
Goals in this course are divided into practical laboratory techniques 
as well as broader skills that will contribute to a deeper understanding 
of science, communication, and experimental design. The identified 
learning goals and objectives are evaluated through aligned assessments 
detailed in Table 1.

Learning Objectives
Students will be able to:
âÃÂ¢ use reasoning and deductive methods to develop a testable hypothesis 
and predict expected results.
âÃÂ¢ gather empirical and measurable evidence through observation and 
experimentation.
âÃÂ¢ assess cellular processes and mechanisms that lead to physiological 
functions.
âÃÂ¢ describe the principles of evolutionary theory and the mechanisms 
leading to genetic diversity",,"Given its setting as an inquiry-driven laboratory, this course 
fundamentally includes many active learning techniques. Each 
lab session begins with a brief demonstration and/or lecture-
based orientation to the dayâÃÃ´s activities, but the vast majority 
of time in class is spent engaged in hands-on laboratory 
research or small-group data analysis and discussion. Students 
gain firsthand experience with all lab techniques, providing 
valuable skills that they will carry forward in their careers. 
Students collect, graph, and analyze their data. Generation and 
evaluation of de novo research data stimulates independent 
literary research to enable the student to explain and teach 
their findings to their peers. Students work in groups of three or 
four to develop skills in teamwork, effective communication, 
and critical thinking, consistent with the collaborative nature 
of CUREs (9).
Students are also given multiple opportunities to develop 
skills in scientific communication. To strengthen their ability to 
analyze and interpret primary journal articles, students engage 
in guided discussions of key papers related to the project, 
using a published data-focused strategy (20). These exercises 
also help the students to learn the structure and organization of 
an original research article, and students directly translate this 
knowledge by preparing the key components (introduction, 
materials and methods, results, discussion) based on their own 
research outcomes (Supporting File S1. Bacterial Evolution âÃÃ¬ 
Course Manual with Teaching Guides, Student Protocols, and 
Assessments). Each component is independently prepared 
by weaving together all lab sessions within a few pages, 
challenging students to differentiate essential and non-
essential 
information and helping them practice concise 
scientific argumentation. Detailed feedback is provided by 
the instructor, then the students compile and integrate all 
components to write a final lab report, which essentially 
culminates in a manuscript describing original research. In 
addition, the students communicate their research findings to 
their peers and the instructor in a graded oral presentation. 
Multiple rounds of peer and instructor feedback throughout 
these processes allow revision of hypotheses, goals, and 
written work, both allowing for formative assessment and 
emphasizing the iterative and collaborative characteristics of 
science. In addition to developing communication skills, the 
summative written and oral assessments encourage the student 
to revisit their obtained knowledge, which is paramount in 
skill acquisition (21).",,Formative assessment; Paper / report / problem set; Presentation; Quiz; Data (hand in a dataset and/or figure); Other,"Lab notebooks, Lab Performance and Exit Tickets","Student achievement of learning objectives is assessed in

Protocols, and Assessments). Because this course was originally 
developed to satisfy a Duquesne University intensive writing 
curriculum requirement, a substantial portion of the work 
centers around scientific communication:
âÃÂ¢ Writing and Paper Interpretation Assignments (50%): 
This portion of the grade is split between formative 
assessments of early drafts of each individual section 
of the laboratory report, written analyses of primary 
research articles, and âÃÃ¬ as a form of summative 
assessment âÃÃ¬ the final complete draft of the lab report, 
which is structured in the format of a primary journal 
article. Students receive extensive feedback from 
instructors and also engage in peer review to model 
authentic science practices.
âÃÂ¢ Team Oral Presentation (10%): Although the writing 
assignments 
in the course are completed on an 
individual basis, each group of students is tasked with 
working as a team to generate and deliver an oral 
presentation. This collaboration drives them to come 
to a consensus on their interpretation of their groupâÃÃ´s 
data. Students are also assessed on their ability to ask 
thoughtful questions during their peersâÃÃ´ presentations. 
Students are awarded both group and individual grades 
on the presentation to foster collaboration while also 
maintaining fairness.
âÃÂ¢ Quizzes (20%): Throughout the semester, several short-
answer quizzes are administered. These focus largely 
on application, providing an additional opportunity 
for students to demonstrate their ability to interpret the 
kinds of data they are gathering. Quiz questions also 
ask students to show that they understand the rationale 
of the experimental approaches they are taking in the 
lab.
âÃÂ¢ Lab Notebook (10%): Students keep detailed 
lab 
notebooks, consistent with learning authentic scientific 
practices. Notebooks are assessed on the basis of 
adherence to formatting, comprehensiveness, and 
accuracy.
âÃÂ¢ Lab Performance and Exit Tickets (10%): Students are 
assessed on their lab citizenship (including appropriate 
attire, collaborative behavior, and responsible clean-
up) as well as their ability to answer the Exit Ticket 
""Questions To Think About"" found at the end of each 
lab session guide. By answering these questions 
before departing each lab, students confirm that they 
understand the rationale behind the work they are 
doing and are able to take ownership of the project and 
make decisions about upcoming experiments",,Yes,"Cited as supplemental materials, supporting materials, or in an appendix",,Neutral,

Curricular gaps about PTEM nevertheless remain; although lessons targeting PTEM at small scales (chemical, molecular, cellular) and large scales (ecological, global) are most common, they do not necessarily address understanding of the intervening organismal scale. Moreover, at the organismal scale, student reasoning about PTEM in one taxonomic category (e.g., animal growth) does not necessarily transfer to others (e.g., fungal growth). Building on prior studies, we developed five organismal-scale activities about animals, plants, and fungi that address misconceptions, promote active learning, and require minimal background knowledge of chemistry.

inclusive and equitable teaching practices. Many approaches 
were 
implemented to make the course more personal, 
structured, and engaging, in line with recommendations for 
building an inclusive environment suitable for all learners (21).
The design and delivery of curricular materials was based on 
evidence about student reasoning, and the impact of diverse 
backgrounds and prior experiences on learning. All classes 
incorporated collaborative group work conducted in small, 
permanent groups (3-4 students). The groups were engineered 
to be diverse in terms of studentsâÃÃ´ prior coursework, majors, 
and demographic variables. Diverse groups were generated 
using the ""create_groups"" function in the R package âÃÃ²minDiffâÃÃ´ 
v. 0.01-3 (22). This function assigns students to N groups by 
minimizing (via 10,000 repetitions) the differences among 
groups for one or multiple criteria (e.g., prior biology courses, 
plan, demographic variables). The result is a set of group 
assignments in which students are heterogenous within groups 
and homogeneous among groups.
Each group was assigned to work with a UGTA who was 
responsible for formally documenting group progress and 
trying to understand thinking in order to foster learning. 
Each UGTA oversaw a maximum of 35 students. UGTAs 
were responsible for knowing studentsâÃÃ´ names and seating 
locations and were able to identify when groups were in 
need of assistance. UGTAs were utilized to help the instructor 
gauge student engagement and identify topics that were 
difficult for students. UGTAs wore name tags and students 
were provided with name tents. The instructor made efforts to 
call students by their names in every class, both during small 
group conversations and during class-wide discussions. The 
instructor also used transparent and low-stakes ""cold calling"" 
to encourage engagement during activities and to foster the 
contribution of diverse student voices.

To appropriately prepare UGTAs for their important roles, 
they participated in 4.5 hours of workshops throughout the 
semester (focusing on cognition, engagement, and diversity) 
that sought to encourage inclusive teaching practices and a 
growth mindset. UGTAs were also prepared weekly with 
information about the upcoming activities, content, and 
learning difficulties they could expect to encounter.",,,Yes,,Yes,,"Learning Goal(s)

unobservable biological processes (i.e., photosynthesis, cellular 
respiration, and digestion) at the organismal level (aligns with 
Ecological Society of America Four-Dimensional Ecology Education 
Framework D.2).
âÃÂ¢ Students will connect everyday notions of food with chemical 
concepts in order to explain how food is used by organisms to carry 
out biological processes.
âÃÂ¢ Students will engage in the practice of scientific modeling by 
building explanatory models that link patterns and processes about 
matter and energy.
Learning Objective(s)
Activity 1: Introducing Matter and Energy
âÃÂ¢ Students will be able to determine if they hold misconceptions 
about matter and energy in organisms.
âÃÂ¢ Students will be able to reason about biological systems by tracing 
matter and energy in organisms separately.
Activity 2: Understanding What is (and is not) Food
âÃÂ¢ Students will be able to connect everyday, macroscopic notions of 
food with chemical concepts (e.g., bonds, molecules).
âÃÂ¢ Students will be able to compare and contrast food and non-food 
for plants, animals, and fungi and explain what characteristics make 
something food for living organisms.
Activity 3: Predicting Mass Change Across the Tree of Life
âÃÂ¢ Students will be able to use their understanding of photosynthesis 
and cellular respiration to accurately predict patterns of mass 
change in plants, animals, and fungi.
âÃÂ¢ Students will be able to qualitatively predict how biological 
processes in a plant, animal, or fungus will contribute to the amount 
of carbon dioxide and oxygen in the air over time in open and 
closed environments.
Activity 4: Explaining Changes in Matter and Energy Using Conceptual 
Models
âÃÂ¢ Students will be able to integrate concepts about matter and energy 
across different biological scales.
âÃÂ¢ Students will be able to build conceptual models capable of 
explaining patterns of matter movement (e.g., mass gain, loss) in 
different organisms (e.g., plants, animals) and contexts (e.g., sunny 
and cloudy environments, active or sedentary behaviors).

Wetlands include marshes, bogs, swamps and similar communities.  Wetlands are ecologically important because they clean polluted water, reduce downstream flooding, and provide habitat for many species. Wetlands are great examples of how spatial and temporal change in the water table, impacted by humans, can affect biodiversity in local and adjacent habitats.  Because of their importance to humans, wetlands are protected from development by federal and state law.  Identifying wetlands is an important skill that anybody should know how to do.  This activity, which follows the Ecological Society of AmericaÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs Four Dimensional Ecology Education (4DEE) approach (4DEE Committee 2020), contains three components.  The first is a Powerpoint presentation that provides background into the basic principles of wetlands, including the definition and classification of wetlands, their functions and values, and some legal aspects surrounding wetlands.  The second component provides students with the opportunity to identify wetlands through the National Wetland Inventory maps produced by the US Fish & Wildlife Service.  Those maps are online and freely available to the public.  In the third component, students learn how to identify wetlands in the field.  To do so, they travel to a site containing a known wetland.

This activity has three components. The first is a Powerpoint presentation that provides basic

component, the students will conduct a field exercise, after which they will learn about how the 
vegetation, soils, and pattern of water availability differ between wetlands and adjoining uplands. 
The overall goal of this exercise is to improve the ability of students to think as ecologists, 
combining theory with mapping and field observations. That skill should carry over to subsequent 
assignments in the course.

By combining the Powerpoint presentation to the mapping activity and the in field wetland 
identification, this exercise satisfies all four of the dimensions of the 4DEE framework, endorsed by

while viewing the presentation.
The second part of the assignment asks the students to visit a website that contains maps of 
wetlands throughout the United States. Students are to select an area that is familiar to them, 
navigate to the site, and determine the presence and extent of any wetlands in that area. 
Your role is to give students an opportunity to examine a wetland and an 
upland site for comparison. Ideally, the two sites should be in relatively close proximity to each

Typically, very large populations are needed, which can be addressed by using micro-organisms. However, students can struggle with phenotyping microbes. For macroscopic organisms, the number of offspring produced, and the generation time can be challenging. I developed this lesson as a small-scale genetic screen of Fast PlantsÃÂÃÂ®. These plants are amenable to teaching labs as they have simple growth requirements, a short generation time, and produce numerous seeds that can be stored for years. Seeds used for this screen are purchased pre-treated with a DNA damaging agent, removing the need for in-house use of mutagens. Also, students can screen the phenotypes without specialized equipment. The initial lesson begins with an examination of the first generation of plants. Later their offspring are screened for altered phenotypes. Students responded well to having full-grown plants available on the first day of the lab project. This lesson fostered student collaboration, as they worked with class datasets.

room with shared benchtops or tables for groups of students. 
A plant growth shelf with lights is required but this equipment 
can be in another room and the plants moved to and from the 
lab as needed. A lab cart is helpful for this purpose. The lesson 
also needs a workspace suitable for planting seeds, such as a 
work area or the lab cart itself. If the class also has a discussion 
day in the lab room, a computer and overhead projector 
would be useful for showing the introductory slides (found

of Fast Plants. These plants are amenable to teaching labs as they have simple growth requirements, a short generation 
time, and produce numerous seeds that can be stored for years. Seeds used for this screen are purchased pre-treated with a 
DNA damaging agent, removing the need for in-house use of mutagens. Also, students can screen the phenotypes without 
specialized equipment. The initial lesson begins with an examination of the first generation of plants. Later their offspring 
are screened for altered phenotypes. Students responded well to having full-grown plants available on the first day of the 
lab project. This lesson fostered student collaboration, as they worked with class datasets. Differences in growth due to

the chance to get feedback from someone with a different point 
of view, and who may have had different courses and scientific 
training. For example, some students were currently working 
in research labs, some had not performed any lab work since 
introductory biology (which may have been online), some had 
spent their entire undergraduate time at our university, and 
others were transfers from different institutions. Students also 
use multiple methods to collect data. They observe the plants

Included an analysis of the sensitivity of
parameters in the lab report",,"Our primary pedagogical approach with this project is to maintain a loosely guided con-
versation with our students, and not to instruct them through a series of prescribed steps.
Although very few have been introduced to partial differential equation (PDE) movement
models, we attempt to arrive at the labs collectively as a natural means for investigating
dispersal. Hence, our unit of instruction begins with the general observation that animals
and plants move in space. We provide some historical background, similar to that outlined
above, and initiate a discussion of patterns of animal movement. This can be sophisticated
if certain types of biologists are in the class, but in any case, everyone has watched ants
or ladybird beetles or seen fish swim, so there is always a common background. Through
directed discussion, we lead the students to the role of randomness in searching decisions.
From this, a probabilistic derivation follows naturally, and then to the continuous time
system and PDEs. Details of this derivation are presented below.

Once the basic mathematical framework is available, more directed discussion gets the
class to study small animals either swimming or crawling. The fundamental biological
assumptions in a diffusion model (e.g., no individual interactions, no effect of external
environment) are elicited from the students and considered in the context of choosing an
experimental organism and protocols. We introduce the brine shrimp and their biology,
and discuss experimental objectives and constraints imposed by available materials and
space. Biological and experimental details are presented below. Depending on the timing
of class periods, it can be profitable to have these discussions in a class period before
the experiments are performed, allowing students more input into variations of the basic
experimental design

The project follows the two basic steps of all mathematical biosciences: parameteriza-
tion and validation/falsification. Here, we present the most common form that the brine
shrimp diffusion project takes; (1) students follow individual shrimp and record positions
and times to estimate a diffusion coefficient D, and (2) students count numbers of shrimp
in regions over time for comparison with analytic predictions. All students do both activ-
ities in small groups
",,Formative assessment; Paper / report / problem set; Data (hand in a dataset and/or figure),,"Due to the interactive nature of project-based learning, continual assessment of student
learning is required to guide instructional strategies. For formative assessment, we listen
carefully to student contributions during class discussions. Ideas offered by students are
frequently incorporated into our presentation of new information; we ask many leading,
open-ended questions to ensure that central ideas are eventually articulated by students
and based on their individual experiences. During the class period, it is important for
the instructors to circulate to the various groups, listen to questions raised, and problem-
solving strategies. Generally, this is not passive; carefully framed questions and observa-
tions keep students engaged and facilitate their nascent ideas. We require a project from
small groups containing a mix of biologists and mathematicians. We observe both intra-
group learning (mainly math students teaching biologists) and intergroup learning, since
we require on-going progress reports for the entire class. This presents students with al-
ternative approaches to the same problem. When time permits, the whole class shares and
discusses approaches to problems arising in data collection or model evaluation.
The target question, ""How much like a random walk is the brine shrimp movement?""
forces students to synthesize their understanding of the diffusion model in a written report.
Individual or group reports are checked for mathematical accuracy to see that students
have made true statements, correct calculations, and performed appropriate algorithms.
Work is also evaluated for appropriate incorporation of mathematical equations and ex-
pressions as well as data and plots into a narrative that relays an acceptable understand-
ing of the model and its applicability in the particular case of our experimental set-up.

As an alternative education approach, we have developed a student-driven lesson plan that utilizes activelearning techniques.

students will know why rates of non-disjunction in meiosis occur 

primarily in older women. Finally, students will appreciate the im
portance of meiosis in the process of reproduction and fertility issues 

that occur in older females. 

Learning Objective(s)

After completion of the lesson students will be able to:

1. 
Describe the differences between female and male meiosis.

2. 
Interpret graphical data to make decisions relevant to medical 

practices.

3. 
Develop a hypothesis that explains the difference in incidence 

of aneuploidy in gametes between males and females.",,"""Activities outside of class: Textbook and primary literature

DRD4 was a good candidate to provide a lab exercise that would be more engaging than VNTR analysis of a non-coding segment.

DRD4 has three common variants of the 48 bp sequence on exon 3, easily differentiated through gel electrophoresis. The 2 repeat (2R), 4 repeat (4R) and 7 repeat (7R) of the 48 bp sequence are the most common alleles. The 7R sequences result in the expressed dopamine D4 receptor having less affinity for dopamine binding, which was proposed to be the reason individuals engage in ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂnovelty seekingÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ behavior, to increase dopamine release to facilitate more binding to the receptor.

Learning objectives:
Students should develop certain skills working through case studies like this one. Their 
observational powers should develop as they learn to look beyond the first impression of the 
image and pick out details. They will make assumptions about what is happening in the picture 
and with guidance from the instructor will learn to frame those assumptions as hypotheses. 
Once they have developed these hypotheses they should be able to come up with tests that 
could disprove their hypotheses. Some tests may be done using information from the picture, 
others might need further information not provided. The important skill is to develop 
hypotheses and understand how to test them. Finally, students should learn something about 
the basics of evolution and the ecology of migratory birds.

Objectives of the Case :
When the students have finished this case study they will
1. have increased their ability to examine photographs for details. Often students think 
that the pictures are interesting but donâÃÃ´t go beyond this idea. Be forcing the student to 
notice small details of the photographs, they will now look at other photographs with a 
keener eye.
2. have created a hypothesis about why an animal behaves in a certain way. 
3. have to rethink their original hypothesis in light of new information. Since all the 
information is presented as photographs, students have to hone their observational 
skills. 
4. have developed their abilities to connect different concepts in biology and understand 
the importance of the relationships between them.
5. have gained confidence in their own abilities to gather and interpret data",,"This case can be presented in a number of ways. Our preference in to present the photograph

",,"""Because the Modules can be used in many different 

contexts, the instructor could use multiple active-learning 

approaches. However, in most of our implementations, 

students work in groups of two or three using their own 

computers or computers in a computer lab. The instructor 

gives a brief introduction to the Module, and then students 

discuss each part of the lesson within their small groups while 

they explore using the browser. We also often use large group 

discussions of student questions and challenging concepts. 

Typically, students work together to complete each Module 

and submit their answers to the questions associated with each 

Module to their instructor. This is consistent with the classic 

definition of active learning as ""anything that involves students 

in doing things and thinking about the things they are doing"" 

(19). Active learning often includes higher order thinking tasks 

such as analysis, evaluation and synthesis, and this may be 

especially true for group work (6, 19). As students discuss the 

exercises within each Module, they gather evidence, evaluate 

potential answers to each question, and occasionally resolve 

contradictions in the evidence.

Using a group format has some risks of uneven participation, 

but generally stimulates useful dialogue. Some instructors have 

used the Modules as an outside-of-class independent project, 

in which students work through each Module independently, watching the videos that accompany each Module, and 

answering the questions in each Module for submission.""",,Formative assessment; Quiz,,"""Each Module contains multiple embedded questions to

The educational module described here builds upon

The module consists of three distinct but related sets 
of inquiry-driven activities that are designed to be used 
together or as stand-alone exercises. The specific objec-
tives for each part of the module are given at the start 
of the associated online materials. More generally, using 
responses to climate change by Yosemite chipmunks as 
a starting point, each portion of the module introduces 
students to critical concepts in organismal and evolu-
tionary biology that are relevant to a component of the 
MAD response. Using these concepts, students develop 
hypotheses and test predictions regarding the impacts 
of changing climatic conditions on specific aspects of 
chipmunk biology. Students then extract, organize, and 
interpret relevant specimen-based data. By constructing 
graphs and completing simple statistical tests, students 
formally test their hypotheses, after which interpreta-
tion of these outcomes can be used to relate information 
contained in museum data back to key concepts and pat-
terns of response to changing climatic conditions. Thus
the module uses a real-world example to engage students

appreciation of the significance of meiosis, as it relates to all 

sexually reproducing organisms: plants, animals and humans.""",,,No,,Yes,,"Learning Goals

The scientific teaching context of this lesson is in the fields of cell 

biology and genetics, focusing primarily on concepts of chromosome 

behavior during meiosis and thus transmission genetics and patterns 

of inheritance. Students will learn

âÃÂ¢ 
the components and mechanisms necessary for successful 

meiosis;

âÃÂ¢ 
of replication of chromosomes through to the formation of 

haploid gamete cells;

âÃÂ¢ 
of the importance of chiasma formation to recombination of 

homologues;

âÃÂ¢ 
that chiasma formation and centromere (kinetochore) behavior 

are key elements to proper segregation of homologous 

chromosomes and genetic recombination.

Learning Objectives

Students will

âÃÂ¢ 
be able to compare and contrast mitosis and meiosis;

âÃÂ¢ 
be able to explain effectively, in a professional manner, how 

meiosis works to an uninformed audience, such as peers who 

are not biology majors;

âÃÂ¢ 
gain expertise in explaining on a professional level the nuances of 

such features of meiosis as synapsis, chiasma formation, syntelic 

and amphitelic orientation; controlled loss of sister chromatid 

cohesion as the trigger for anaphase I and anaphase II;

âÃÂ¢ 
become familiar with sources of errors in meiotic mechanisms 

and thus defective chromosome and gene transmission.",,"""The effectiveness of PoppitMeiosis lies in its hands-

on nature. The exercise emphasizes the way bivalents are 

constructed for and proceed through meiosis, with emphasis 

on (a) the vital role of chromosome replication before meiosis 

itself begins, and thus the âÃÃ²math of meiosisâÃÃ´; (b) pairing and 

exchange (chiasma formation) of homologues; (c) kinetochore 

attachment to the spindle during meiosis I and meiosis II; and 

(d) the differential loss of arm and centromere cohesion at 

onset of anaphase I and anaphase II. These essential elements 

of meiosis need best be visualized and even touched, not just 

talked or read about. PoppitMeiosis offers students hands-on 

experience that leads them in that direction.""",,Quiz; Other,survey with 45 mitosis/meiosis questions to evaluate knowledge,"""In the Teaching Discussion section of this article, a method

participants as they are continuously asked to discuss the 

examples being presented by routinely utilizing think-pair-share 

and whole-class discussion. All definitions to be given during 

this activity should first be discovered through group discussion and then formalized by the instructor. This activity gives students 

opportunities to examine real environmental factors and make 

informed predictions about the outcomes. It also allows them to 

actively participate in a game that will generate the variation of 

life history strategies that will be the springboard for a discussion 

of life history in general.""",,Quiz,,"""To test the effectiveness of the activities on actual learning 

gains, we created five pairs of questions with a pair of questions 

testing five different principles. The first question pair tested 

studentsâÃÃ´ understanding of the impact of predation on the age 

at which organisms mature and begin reproduction in different 

predation environments, which was not explicitly discussed 

during the activity. The second pair of questions tested studentsâÃÃ´ 

understanding of the fundamental life history tradeoffs and how 

energy investment changes over time. These tradeoffs were never 

discussed but experienced as students completed the activity. 

The third pair of questions tested studentsâÃÃ´ understanding of the 

mechanisms of natural selection as explained in the activity. The 

fourth pair tested studentsâÃÃ´ understanding of terminal investment 

also as explained in the activity. The final pair tested studentsâÃÃ´ 

ability to determine which of two life history strategies would 

be most successful in each environment as depicted by a graph 

making this both a test of conceptual understanding as well 

as a studentâÃÃ´s ability to interpret a graph. Each question pair 

was divided and assigned at random to one of two quizzes 

generating two parallel quizzes, version A and version B, to be 

utilized as pre-quizzes and post-quizzes (Supporting File S1. 

Life History âÃÃ¬ Quizzes).

Before beginning the activity, all students (n=100) were given 

a quiz. The version of the quiz (A or B) given to each student 

was assigned randomly. After pre-quizzes were collected, we 

administered the activity. Following the activity, the students 

were given the alternative version of the quiz (i.e., if they took 

version A as a pre-quiz, they took version B as a post-quiz and 

vice versa). This practice attempted to eliminate any possible 

test-retest effects, especially considering that the pre-quizzes 

and post-quizzes were given in such close temporal proximity. 

In addition, because half of the students took version A as a 

pre-quiz and half took version B as a pre-quiz, we hoped to 

control for any differences in performance due to unintended 

discrepancies in quiz difficulty.

To analyze the quiz data, collected quizzes were scored based 

on whether the student selected a correct or incorrect answer. 

Because surveys were anonymous (due to IRB constraints), it 

was not possible to match pre-quizzes with post-quizzes for 

each student. Thus, our pre-quiz condition was treated as an 

independent sample from our post-quiz condition. We therefore 

analyzed the data only in terms of comparing mean pre and 

post scores and the mean for the individual questions, and not 

via the paired samples t-test that would have been utilized had

What Happens
Students are placed in teams of five (or whatever number the instructor 
considers suitable). The instructor provides a brief introduction to the concepts of 
gradients in species richness, and local vs. regional patterns of land cover / land use. Student teams generate hypotheses for why bird species richness varies 
across localities, including hypotheses about local land cover, regional land cover 
/ land use, and continental gradients in climate. Students are provided an excel 
spreadsheet with avian point count sample data from a longitudinal transect 
across eastern North America, extracted from the USGS Bird Point Count Data 
Base (Transect Data Tables.xlsx), and a set of example data (Transect 1 
Example Points.pptx, Transect 2 Example Points.pptx, Transect 3 Example 
Points.pptx). Each student samples five points, ideally each at a different 
location, so a team of five then samples 25 locations spanning 20 -30 degrees 
longitude from the east coast of North America to the interior of the continent. For 
each location, students quantify land use at two spatial scales using the National 
Land Cover Database. The teams then test the predictions of their hypotheses 
graphically by plotting relevant land use / land cover measures, local species 
pool or longitude against species richness. Each team then makes a short oral

make policy-making more transparent and integrates multiple

teaching assistants circulate among the groups to ensure that 
discussion time is equally shared. Second, the instructor can 
give timing prompts to give each member of the group an equal 
time to share their opinions. In addition, we recommend that 
the instructor assign a student in each group to be a discussion

than summative assessment techniques because of pre-
existing restraints on course requirements, assessment, and

the in-class session to evaluate studentsâÃÃ´ ability to synthesize 
the relevant scientific information surrounding the topic 
and a reflection prompt to evaluate how the in-class activity 
changed the studentâÃÃ´s perspective on the environmental issue

a rubric for this assignment in which students write a white 
paper offering a scientific perspective and solution to the 
environmental issue prior to the in-class activity (Supporting

then can modify their white paper after the in-class activity.

decision making process), the group two-minute report-outs 
are a formative assessment evaluating how students describe 
their understanding of the structured decision making process.
For learning objective 2 (reflecting on stakeholder roles), 
the reflection statement and the group report-outs are 
formative assessments. Students self-evaluate their learning 
by completing the reflection exercise and by doing the brief 
report-out to the entire class.

Cell and Molecular Biology course from Spring 2015-Winter 
2018 included: 30% first-generation college students (defined 
as having two parents who did not complete college), 71% low-
income FAFSA applicants, and 16.4% students who identify as 
belonging to a traditionally underserved racial minority group 
(Hispanic/Latinx, African American/Black, Native American/
Alaskan Native, Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander, or 
Filipino/Hmong/Vietnamese). It is known that many students, 
especially those from the groups listed above, leave science 
not because they lack the potential to succeed, but because 
they do not identify with those in the scientific community or 
view themselves as capable of success as scientists (12,20). By 
infusing explicit practice with metacognition in the context of 
a research module, we aim to have all of our students become 
aware of their engagement as legitimate scientists with diverse 
experiences and points of view.
To increase the sense that a scientist identity is achievable 
by our students, we explicitly connect metacognitive 
processes that are critical for science (listed in Table 1) to 
the laboratory and metacognitive module activities that the 
students engage in. Moreover, the opportunity to engage in 
a true scientific struggle allows students to reframe difficult 
moments in science as a natural part of doing real science 
rather than a referendum on their own potential as scientists, 
potentially 
increasing student development of a growth 
mindset towards science. 
In our 
implementation of this 
module as a Tetrahymena-focused research project, we were 
also able to introduce relevant preliminary data that had been 
obtained by another undergraduate student researcher (21). In 
sum, students can make the connection that research can be 
difficult, that previous research can be improved upon, and 
that they can be the ones to improve upon it.
The structure of this module requires the equal participation 
of all students, with evidence of their involvement collected 
in the form of various assessments, including worksheets and 
participation in class discussions. Students are given time to 
process concepts and organize their own thoughts through take-
home work or in small-group explorations before being asked 
to report out to the class or to complete hands-on laboratory 
activities. This provides students with the opportunity to fully 
participate in and bolster their confidence for in-class work. 
The metacognitive prompts and assigned homework are 
designed to be inclusive of diverse points of view, allowing 
for a variety of possible answers (see Supporting Files S8-
S10). Finally, we emphasize the importance and strength 
of a diverse community to making scientific progress in our

Conversely, other studies have shown that species richness peaks at moderate levels of human influence when using a measurement such as the number of houses.  Since the 1970s ecologists have measured a number of different human influence measures (e.g., human population, number of houses, percent impervious surface) to explore how biodiversity patterns change, yielding three basic types of relationships.

LESSON PLAN
The class session takes place in a standard lecture room 
that can seat a class of 100 students. The room is equipped 
with tabletops and chairs that swivel to allow easy discussion 
with students around and behind them. A document camera 
and projector allow for easy modeling of the structures and 
demonstrating the construction of Holliday junction with the 
chenille sticks. The overall lesson timeline can be found in 
Table 1.
Pre-Class Preparation
Procure chenille stems (a.k.a. ""pipe cleaners"", approximately 
12-14 inches long) in four different colors (e.g., red, blue, 
yellow, white). Using scissors or wire snips, cut the stems in half, 
producing short pieces that are ~6 - 8 in long. Collect one of 
each color into a set of four, and loosely twist so that it is easy 
to distribute to each student in the class.
Prepare color copies of the in-class problem set for distribution 
(Supporting File S1. Holliday Junction âÃÃ¬ In-Class Problem Set).
In practice, we have found that it is useful for the instructor 
to practice building the manipulative 2-5 times before class, 
as well as guide any Learning Assistants/Teaching Assistants 
through the activity so that they are prepared to assist students.

other students and reflect on their learning.",,Formative assessment; Paper / report / problem set; Presentation; Summative Assessment; Other,reflection,"We designed this assignment to include formative assessments. 
Formative assessment is a student-centered teaching approach 
that is particularly effective because it engages students by 
providing timely feedback to both instructors and students about 
learning (8,12). As part of the formative assessment, students 
needed to submit requests for additional medical tests and design 
questions for the patient, while providing the rationales for the 
tests and questions. The rationales were extremely informative 
for determining whether students were thinking carefully about 
their patientâÃÃ´s history and symptoms, or just requesting a plethora 
of tests in order to get more information. The initial group report 
also provided a valuable opportunity to ensure students had the 
correct diagnosis before preparing their final report.
Summative assessments included the final group report 
(students could choose to do either a presentation or a written 
report) and the individual responses to the follow-up questions. 
We found the individual responses to follow-up questions 
extremely useful for determining each studentâÃÃ´s understanding.

included in Supporting File S1. Medical Case Study - Instructions. 
No rubric was used for the individual responses, but the

The abundance of CPA in pancreatic tissue allows for a series of common biochemical techniques to be easily performed under the constraints of an undergraduate teaching lab, including the separation of proteins by simple precipitation methods, the examination of resulting proteins by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining, and the analysis of enzyme function through the determination of constants such as Vmax and Km. These steps illustrate the importance of noncovalent bonds in protein structure and the use of common biochemical instruments in the lab, while providing students with an opportunity to hone analysis skills in their consideration of the resulting data. Finally, this lab may be modified in many ways to make it suitable for upper division classes, CURE approaches to the undergraduate lab, and even to the pre-college classroom.",8853,Lyons 2022,Andrews University,,Andrews University,"This laboratory activity is best suited for an introductory cell

able to get some reasonable data in this series of experiments

being studied. While the enzyme activity data is quantitative

First, by learning to breathe quietly and sit absolutely still and unobtrusively in nature for extended periods of time, students discover that they can observe, at very close range, the actuality-not to mention the beauty and fascination-of animals going about their lives.

Second, through disciplined stillness, students discover their own acute powers of listening and observation, capacities they did not know they could cultivate. In field natural history classes, my students have carried out detailed field studies on bird, mammal, insect, and spider behavior and have consistently reflected that these strategies were vitally important to their field studies.

assigned after students learned about photosynthesis, and 
Part 2 was assigned after students learned about regulation 
of gene expression and Mendelian genetics. The assignments

the Evolution Course, we focused on directly addressing the 
connections between the activity and plant structure, function 
and development (Supporting Material S6, questions 2-4, 7-9),

misconceptions on a variety of topics covered during the 
semester. Some common misconceptions targeted include 
the difference between differentiation and determination, 
the differences in gene regulation between prokaryotes and  eukaryotes, where photosynthesis occurs in plants, and from 
where plants get a majority of their dry mass. Common mistakes 
found during the grading of the homework assignments were 
addressed in class in a following lecture. These assignments

As the lateral line forms in the first two days of zebrafish development, axons extend caudally along the lateral surface of the fish, eventually forming synapses with hair cells of neuromasts. Growing lateral line axons are located superficially under the skin and can be labeled in living zebrafish using fluorescent protein expression. This system provides a relatively straightforward approach for in vivo time-lapse imaging of neuronal development in an undergraduate setting. Here we describe an upper-level neurobiology laboratory module in which students investigate aspects of axonal development in the zebrafish lateral line system. Students learn to handle and image living fish, collect timelapse videos of moving mitochondria, and quantitatively measure mitochondrial dynamics by generating and analyzing kymographs of their movements. Energy demands may differ between axons with extending growth cones versus axons that have already reached their targets and are forming synapses. Since relatively little is known about this process in developing lateral line axons, students generate and test their own hypotheses regarding how mitochondrial dynamics may differ at two different time points in axonal development. Students also learn to incorporate into their analysis a powerful yet accessible quantitative tool, the kymograph, which is used to graph movement over time. After students measure and quantify dynamics in living fish at 1 and 2 days post fertilization, this module extends into independent projects, in which students can expand their studies in a number of different, inquiry-driven directions. The project can also be pared down for courses that wish to focus solely on the quantitative analysis (without fish handling), or vice versa.

âÃÂ¢ 
Students will understand how molecules and ions of variable sizes 
and compositions are transported across a cellâÃÃ´s membrane.
âÃÂ¢ 
Students will demonstrate the ability to work collaboratively

-
Students will demonstrate the ability to communicate their under
standing of membrane transport verbally and kinesthetically 
Learning Objective(s)
Students will be able to:
âÃÂ¢ 
-
Compare and contrast the mechanisms of simple diffusion, facili
tated diffusion, and active transport (both primary and secondary).
âÃÂ¢ 
Identify, and provide a rationale for, the mechanism(s) by which 
various substances cross the plasma membrane.
âÃÂ¢ 
Describe the steps involved in the transport of ions by the Na+/K+ 
pump, and explain the importance of electrogenic pumps to the 
generation and maintenance of membrane potentials.
âÃÂ¢ 
-
Explain the function of electrochemical gradients as potential ener
gy sources specifically used in secondary active transport.
âÃÂ¢ 
Relate each molecule or ion transported by the Na+/glucose 
cotransporter (SGLT1) to its own concentration or electrochemical 
gradient, and describe which molecules travel with and against ",,"Prior to class, students read sections in their textbook 
covering membrane transport and complete a pre-activity 
worksheet designed to focus their learning on some key 
concepts.
âÃÂ¢ 
In class, Think-Pair-Share (T-P-S) and role-play are used 
to actively engage students in the learning process. As 
the play is essentially unscripted, students must discuss 
and justify their actions as they attempt to apply their 
knowledge to the themes of each act.",,Formative assessment; Exam; Worksheet; Other,pre/post test,"Assessment is ongoing throughout this activity. It is easy to 
gauge what students know through their actions and verbal

responses during the activity can provide additional knowledge. 
Immediate feedback is provided as the instructor plays the 
role of the director of the play; however, allowing students to 
discuss and debate prior to providing corrections is advised. 
In addition, the pre- and post-tests can be administered before 
and after the activity to assess student learning gains, and the 
retention test can be administered at some later date to assess 
retention of concepts. These assessment tools include five 
multiple-choice knowledge/comprehension-based questions

This lesson allows students to engage in the material in a 
variety of ways: individual clicker questions, peer discussion, 
drawing, and writing. Clicker questions, which students answer 
individually for the first vote, allow all students, regardless of 
ability, to engage in thinking and applying their knowledge, 
and receiving feedback (as the clicker questions are always 
followed-up with feedback from the instructor). We do not 
grade the clicker questions for correctness but rather use them 
for instructor and student feedback, creating a feedback-rich, 
low-stakes learning opportunity. Students are allowed to self-
select their peer groups or to work individually (although 
in our experience almost all students participated in the

-
Students will understand how the genetic linkage of loci on chromo

the assortment of alleles during meiosis and phenotypes observed in 
a population

Learning Objective(s)
At the end of the activity, students will be able to:
âÃÂ¢ 
Explain how recombination can lead to new combinations of 
linked alleles.
âÃÂ¢ 
Explain how molecular markers (such as microsatellites) can be 
used to map the location of genes/loci, including what crosses 
would be informative and why.
âÃÂ¢ 
Explain how banding patterns on an electrophoresis gel represent 
the segregation of alleles during meiosis.
âÃÂ¢ 
-
Predict how recombination frequency between two linked loci 
affects the genotype frequencies of the products of meiosis com
pared to loci that are unlinked (or very tightly linked).
âÃÂ¢ 
-
Analyze data from a cross (phenotypes and/or genotypes) to deter
mine if the cross involves linked genes.
âÃÂ¢ 
Calculate the map distance between linked genes using data from 
genetic crosses, such as gel electrophoresis banding patterns.
âÃÂ¢ 
-
Justify conclusions about genetic linkage by describing the infor
mation in the data that allows you to determine genes are linked.",,"
In-class: Students will make predictions, comparisons, and 
teach each other during the group activity. Any confusion 
that is not identified and cleared up by peer group discussion 
will be revealed using the follow-up clicker questions and 
feedback from instructors.
After-class: The follow-up problem-set (ideally done in 
TA-led tutorials or as homework) will provide additional 
opportunities for students to engage in deliberate practice of 
applying their knowledge, making predictions, and analyzing 
data. If the follow-up problem-set is completed during a TA-
led tutorial session, students will be able to receive immediate 
feedback on their thinking and further engage in peer 
discussion about the problem.

open-ended (short answer) question set that tests studentsâÃÃ´ 
conceptual understanding of the use of molecular markers 
for mapping, how banding patterns can be used to determine 
linkage, and their ability to analyze banding patterns to create 
a linkage map. Results of this post-test provide valuable 
information to instructors about student understanding, and 
formative feedback to students. Discussion of the post-test 
results can also provide additional opportunities for students 
and instructors to reflect on their learning.

data from 3 lakes that vary in their productivity and water clarity, allowing them to 
observe how lake ecology can differ both over time and among systems. They will be

and inclusion of students in a variety of ways. This lesson 
captures the diversity of biological sex by including data 
from males and females. This lesson also invokes a number of 
multiple intelligences (69) among a cohort of diverse learners. 
This lab specifically appeals to studentsâÃÃ´ visual-spatial, bodily-
kinesthetic, logical-mathematic, verbal-linguistic, interpersonal, 
and intrapersonal abilities. For students, such capabilities 
expressed in the lab can extend beyond the scope of the course 
and into real-world interactions. The hybrid nature of this lab also 
appeals to differing student mindsets. This laboratory module 
is a hybrid virtual module in the sense that it incorporates the 
use of a virtual dissector table as well as traditional laboratory 
exercises. In addition, this module embraces the essence of 
hybrid learning because students can access its pre-lab reading 
material online via email or an instructional online learning 
management (OLM) interface such as Canvas or Blackboard. This 
pre-lab reading assignment also contains embedded YouTube 
and Khan Academy videos that allow the students to explore 
web-based, digital content in addition to electronic text.
As the promotion of diversity and inclusion within many 
institutions in the United States has become increasingly 
paramount, many organizations and social entities are 
encouraged to adopt standards or policies that celebrate 
the diversity of their members while also fostering inclusive 
environments in which all members feel like part of a cohesive 
team. Such diversity and inclusion standards can be established 
for professional societies, degree programs, and even anatomy 
and physiology classes (70). For example, in this particular 
module, instructors have the opportunity to discuss occupational 
diversity (70) in the context of an anatomy and physiology course. 
Students in the course will ultimately decide to pursue different 
occupations/career paths which in turn can influence the level 
of interest a student may have in a particular topic covered in 
the course. The interested students can then help to motivate 
other students based on their enthusiasm and excitement for the 
topic. This module should particularly appeal to those students 
interested in occupational therapy, physical therapy, or exercise 
science since many of the concepts regarding kinesiology and 
biomechanics are highly relevant to these fields. Instructors 
could offer at the beginning of the lesson a quick explanation 
of why the lab module concepts are pertinent to these particular 
students and/or fields of study. Even if there are no students in
the course who intend to become occupational or physical 
therapists, instructors can discuss how the content pertaining 
to skeletal muscle anatomy would also be revisited in greater 
detail in medical, dental, nurse anesthesia, physician assistant, 
or other anatomy-relevant curricula. Moreover, exposure to 
this content and its career correlations may allow students an 
opportunity to consider such relevant fields as professional 
options. Such exposure is especially important for under-
represented populations including women, trans or gender 
non-conforming, or other underrepresented minority students 
since it might encourage these individuals to help diversify fields 
in which there is a paucity of members of their respective groups. 
For instance, physical therapy is a field often predominated 
by Caucasian men while occupational therapy is a field often 
predominated by Caucasian women; exposure to fields other 
than the stereotypical norms can help educate underrepresented 
students about a more diverse array of options to help them 
make the best decisions for themselves. On the other hand, 
some students might not intend to pursue any health-related 
careers. Nevertheless, instructors could discuss the relevancy of 
the concepts such as metabolism, homeostasis, maximal oxygen 
consumption, and anaerobic capacity to an understanding of 
basic health during physical exercise.
Since students are engaged in physical exercises during the 
lab module, instructors have the opportunity to emphasize 
the importance of physical exercise, in general, in peopleâÃÃ´s 
daily lives. For instructors teaching in states that have higher 
healthcare disparities than normal, providing statistics from 
the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) regarding the 
state of health of their citizens (71) can be a powerful learning 
experience for providing awareness to students. (International 
readers can refer to their respective health institutions for 
similar data.) Such awareness can motivate students then to 
be advocates for healthier lifestyles among their colleagues, 
friends, families, and community members. This advocacy is 
also important even in states or regions that are predominated 
by healthy individuals because there may be some subsets of 
the population which lack healthy lifestyles due to a number of 
factors that can include limited access to healthy foods, lower 
socioeconomic status, reduced health literacy, or other social 
determinants of health (72,73). By creating an atmosphere of 
comradery around physical activity as a critical strategy for 
reducing health disparities and supporting healthy living (74,75), 
instructors can invite students into a learning community that is 
inclusive while also diverse. For example, instructors can support 
an atmosphere of comradery in this lab module by allowing 
the groups to challenge one another to see which group is 
the fittest. Alternatively, instructors could display on the walls 
posters that convey helpful tips for students to incorporate at 
least thirty minutes of exercise (e.g., walking, jogging, biking, 
etc.) into their daily routines and could provide encouraging 
and motivating words to stay healthy. Additionally, instructors 
could provide opportunities for students to create groups to 
support healthy lifestyles and hang photos of individuals of 
diverse backgrounds engaged in physical activities. Instructors 
can also provide encouraging words and highlight helpful tips 
during the exercise physiology component of the lab.
Instructors might also teach classes of anatomy and physiology 
in which students might have disabilities or injuries that prevent 
them from engaging in the exercise physiology lab activities. 
Students with disabilities provide another enriching opportunity
or incorporating experiential diversity (70,76,77) into the class 
and creating a more inclusive environment. Instructors can 
make a number of decisions to accommodate students with 
disabilities or injuries. Instructors can simply allow such students 
to abstain from physical activity and work in close proximity 
with a partner within their lab group or perhaps even serve as 
the scribe for their lab group if they are able. If the students 
have the ability to perform alternative exercises (e.g., manually 
propelling their wheelchairs with their arms), instructors could 
also provide such students with the option of engaging in the lab 
activities under modified circumstances. Either way, instructors 
would consider the freedom of choice and the comfort of the 
students in this decision. Students who chose to abstain could 
be placed into a think-pair-share group with their assigned 
partner within their lab group. In a think-pair-share sequence, 
the students would have an opportunity to think or write about 
and discuss the biological concepts being explored in the lab 
activities (78,79). For instance, in this lab module, if there are 
students using wheelchairs, crutches, or some other assistive 
device for mobility, these students can be prompted to explain 
to their lab group partners how the same concepts of exhaustion 
and muscle fatigue can apply to situations in which they are 
rapidly rotating the wheels of their chair or moving their crutches 
with their arms, perhaps to rush somewhere quickly. In the 
communication exchange, students without disabilities could 
gain insights into the experiences of someone who cannot 
perform tasks that involve physical exertion, like pedaling on 
the stationary bicycle during the Wingate Test or running on the 
treadmill during the maximal oxygen consumption experiment, 
while also sharing their experiences as they perform the Wingate 
Test and running experiments. In this example, the students with 
disabilities are provided an equitable opportunity to engage in 
the lab activities by alternative means since they cannot perform 
the experiments in the same way that other students can, but they 
are also included in the conversation and learning experiences 
with the other students.
Instructors might even choose to adopt a think-pair-share 
policy for all students in the class to promote further inclusion 
and equity (79). Dr. Kimberly D. Tanner also provides a self-
assessment of equitable teaching strategies in her article on 
promoting student engagement and cultivating classroom 
equity (79), so instructors might want to consult this tool when 
evaluating the inclusive nature of their own classroom. While this 
article addresses classroom teaching practices as a whole, many 
of these strategies can be incorporated into this lab module in 
addition to the think-pair-share technique. Because the students 
will already be actively participating in groups, instructors might 
consider ambulating the room and attending to each group 
periodically to ensure that all students are participating either 
in the activities or in discussion concerning the activities and 
that all students are provided fair access to learning, thinking, 
and teaching.",,,Yes,,Yes,,"Learning Goal(s)

when developing laboratory modules and lecture sessions 
in anatomy and physiology courses. This laboratory module 
embodies active learning because it incorporates exercises that 
allow the students to complete work in groups rather than simply 
acquire knowledge in a traditional, more passive, lecture-based 
setting (50). Students who engage in active learning are also 
more likely to obtain critical thinking skills (46). Students are 
also physically performing the exercises themselves and testing 
their knowledge of muscle anatomy through the Anatomage 
Table activities (Figure 2).
One specific form of active learning incorporates the flipped 
classroom. This laboratory module also serves as a flipped 
classroom module because it features a pre-lab reading 
assignment (see Supporting File S3. Hybrid Virtual Kinesiology 
Lab Module âÃÃ¬ Pre-Lab Reading Assignment) that students must 
complete as homework before attending their kinesiology 
laboratory session. This assignment allows the students to take 
responsibility for their own learning before coming to the lab. 
It also frees instructional time for active learning exercises 
which help foster higher-order thinking skills (51) among the 
individual students and during their peer-to-peer interactions. 
More information on the flipped classroom can be found in the 
literature (52,53). The latter source includes a review of other 
studies on the flipped classroom and its efficacy (53). Additional 
studies have explored the development and implementation of 
a professional development program for high school teachers, 
enabling them to learn how to use the flipped classroom model 
(54,55).
In this particular lab module, students had the opportunity to 
view YouTube and Khan Academy videos included as links in 
their pre-lab reading assignment (see Supporting File S3. Hybrid 
Virtual Kinesiology Lab Module âÃÃ¬ Pre-Lab Reading Assignment). 
For instance, if students desired further clarification regarding 
the different muscle fiber types, they could view the video 
associated with the different muscle fiber types. However, if the 
flipped classroom assignments before class do not elucidate the 
lesson content as planned, instructors can rely on additional 
active-learning strategies to help improve their studentsâÃÃ´ 
understanding of the lesson content. For example, if a student 
is struggling to grasp the concept of different muscle fiber types 
and their applications to different types of muscle movements, 
instructors can use aspects of peer instruction (56) by allowing 
other students within the studentâÃÃ´s group to explain the concepts 
to him/her. The instructor could then invite the students to 
vocalize their discussion and ask whether the student had a 
better understanding of the concepts after the discussion. The 
next critical step would entail the instructorâÃÃ´s vocal affirmation 
of the accuracy of the discussion details and any elaboration or 
revision to correct the studentsâÃÃ´ understanding, if necessary. Any 
misunderstandings should also be communicated to the entire 
class to ensure other students do not make similar mistakes.
If instructors want to ensure further that the student has 
learned the content, they can request that the student try to teach 
it to others. This additional active learning strategy known as 
the protâÂ©gâÂ© effect (57,58) has been shown to improve studentsâÃÃ´
metacognition (59), use of effective learning strategies (60), 
motivation to learn (58), sense of competence and autonomy 
(61), performance (60), motor learning (62), and information 
processing (63). Instructors can employ aspects of peer 
instruction and the protâÂ©gâÂ© effect with any other misunderstood 
or difficult-to-understand concept in the lesson",,Formative assessment; Exam; Quiz; Worksheet; Data (hand in a dataset and/or figure); Other,self-evaluation,"The instructors assessed the studentsâÃÃ´ learning by administering 
pre- and post-tests (see Supporting Files S1. Hybrid Virtual 
Kinesiology Lab Module âÃÃ¬ Pre-Test and S4. Hybrid Virtual 
Kinesiology Lab Module âÃÃ¬ Post-Test, respectively) to the students 
before and after their learning experiences, respectively, and 
measuring the change in their performance. The pre- and post-
tests (see Supporting Files S1. Hybrid Virtual Kinesiology Lab 
Module âÃÃ¬ Pre-Test and S4. Hybrid Virtual Kinesiology Lab 
Module- Post-Test, respectively) included the same five open-
ended questions. Students also completed guided questions 
during their Anatomage Table investigations (see Supporting File 
S8. Hybrid Virtual Kinesiology Lab Module âÃÃ¬ Kinesiology Lab 
Guided Questions). Students completed several self-evaluation 
components of the lesson on their Results and Conclusions 
worksheets (see Supporting File S12. Hybrid Virtual Kinesiology 
Lab Module âÃÃ¬ Exercise Physiology Results & Conclusions). 
Students were able to evaluate the accuracy of their performance 
during the lab by calculating the percent error of their power 
calculations versus the power output from the stationary cycles. 
Students were also able to assess the reliability of their findings 
by comparing them to values from peer-reviewed sources. 
Additionally, students were asked to identify muscles and answer 
kinesiology questions on the lab exam. Refer to Table 1 to see 
how these assessments aligned with the lesson learning goals 
and objectives, as well as the guidelines and learning outcomes 
for the Human Anatomy and Physiology Society (HAPS).
In this module, several core concepts in physiology are 
assessed, including homeostasis [Lesson Learning Objective 
(LLO) 1 and 2; Content Integration Goal (CIG) 4 and 5], energy 
(LLO 3), and structure-function relationships (LLO 7 and 8; CIG 
2, 3, and 6). The core concepts of interdependence, levels or 
organization, and scientific reasoning are indirectly addressed 
using different terminology. For instance, the concepts of 
interdependence and levels of organization are inferred by the 
discussion of the vital interaction between molecules within 
muscle fibers (cells), their comprising tissues (i.e., skeletal 
muscle tissue), and the organs (i.e., skeletal muscles) that 
they comprise. The concept of scientific reasoning is inferred 
by the processes students use in conducting their laboratory 
experiments, communicating their results, and analyzing and 
reviewing evidence-based research [LLO 5, 6, 7, and 8; CIG 6; 
Cognitive Skill Development Goal (CSDG) 9, 10, 11, and 12].
These core concepts are a part of a larger body of fifteen Core 
Concepts in Physiology which were proposed and vetted by 
approximately seventy physiology faculty respondents through 
surveys conducted by two other physiologists (64). These core 
concepts and their subconcepts are discussed further in a text 
that also provides additional tips for the design of learning 
resources (65). These tips include maintaining consistency in the 
use of terminology and relying on logical learning progressions 
(66) with the introduction of some subconcepts before others 
(65,67). Instructors can refer to these core concepts and this text 
should they want to align their lessons and assessments with 
additional core concepts. A review of this text mentions that 
while the text encourages the use of multiple-choice questions, it 
asserts that short-answer questions allow students to demonstrate 
their reasoning (67) in a way that multiple-choice questions 
cannot. Such open-ended questions as in the pre- and post-
tests (see Supporting Files S1. Hybrid Virtual Kinesiology Lab 
Module âÃÃ¬ Pre-Test and S4. Hybrid Virtual Kinesiology Lab 
Module âÃÃ¬ Post-Test) can assess studentsâÃÃ´ authentic understanding 
by more effectively lowering the probability of their answering 
the questions by guessing alone as many students do with 
multiple choice questions when they simply do not know 
the answer. The review by Crowther (67) also mentions an 
anatomy and physiology textbook (68) whose author has already 
incorporated many of the suggestions within the Core Concepts
text. Instructors of anatomy and physiology might also want to 
consider consulting this text in further understanding how to

biology students, we designed an engaging multi-week series of related lessons about canine genetics in which students explore 
and answer the question, ""How does the information encoded in DNA lead to physical traits in an organism?"""" ..... "" In our lessons, students collect DNA samples from dogs, isolate and amplify targeted 
sections of DNA through polymerase chain reactions (PCR), and then sequence and analyze DNA for insertions and single 
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) mutations. Utilizing gel electrophoresis and bioinformatics tools, students connect how the 
physical manifestation of traits is rooted in genetic sequences. Students also participate in discussions of scientific literature, 
group collaboration to construct a final poster, and presentation of their findings during a mock scientific poster conference.

Helping students find identity and purpose in science is an 
important aspect of inclusion. In this module, students are 
invited to have a personal investment in the project as they 
bring samples from their personal pets for analysis. Although 
this may seem trivial to some, students often respond to the 
module by referencing how exciting it is to analyze their own 
pets (see Student Reaction section).
In addition, students work in small, collaborative groups 
throughout the module and share expertise amongst themselves. 
In these situations, students of diverse backgrounds often find 
comfort and develop camaraderie with others as they are 
able to use their strengths and bolster their weaknesses in a 
collaborative setting. Finally, the breadth of the activities in 
this module promote inclusive learning through stimulation of 
multiple modalities. For example, students isolate and analyze 
DNA, conduct primary literature research, discuss/debate 
results, and co-create a poster presentation (which is modeled 
after a professional scientific poster session).",,,No,,Yes,,"Learning Goal(s)

with each of the lessons.",,"In Class: In the classroom, the entire module engages 
students in active learning. From start to finish, students are 
active participants in authentic science as they collaborate 
on hands-on lab work and problem-solve in small groups to 
conduct DNA analysis. Students also engage with primary 
literature and, like scientists, actively maintain an accurate, 
up-to-date lab notebook for the duration of the module. 
Students also create a research poster of their results (including 
images of gels, chromatograms, etc.). Furthermore, students 
communicate like scientists as they present for one hour in 
a format mimicking an interactive, scientific research poster 
session (see Supporting File S5. Dog Genetics âÃÃ¬ Lesson 4. Final 
Genotype: Collaborative Poster).
st
Outside of Class: From the beginning of this module, 
students are asked to be active participants in their learning. 
Specifically, students are given pre-lesson reading and 
questions to gauge prior knowledge and build a conceptual 
framework for future learning. Also, students are given the 
materials and expertise to collect data from dogs at their home 
or in their community. For many, this raises engagement as they 
become interested in knowing specific genetic characteristics 
of animals that are close to them and their families. As students 
work on pre-lesson assignments, they model good scientific
procedure by contributing to their ongoing lab notebook. 
Finally, a good portion of the creation of the final research 
poster is completed out-of-class. This is an important part 
of the active learning process, as students must combine 
content knowledge with 21 century skills to set up meetings, 
communicate, compromise, and ultimately develop a final 
product that meets the expectations of all group members.",,Presentation; Quiz; Worksheet; Summative Assessment; Other,"Lab notebook, peer evaluation, poster, discussion, self-assessment","Assessments are embedded throughout the module and

at the end of the module in the form of a quiz (Supporting 
File S8. Dog Genetics âÃÃ¬ Example Quiz Questions) and a 
collaborative poster (Supporting File S9. Dog Genetics âÃÃ¬ Poster 
Template). Additionally, students and instructors intermittently 
discuss the Cadieu et al. (2009) Science paper (1) which was 
the inspiration for this module during the first three lessons. 
Discussions occur during ""down-time,"" e.g., when the gels are 
running during Lesson 2 (Supporting File S3. Dog Genetics âÃÃ¬ 
Lesson 2. Gel Electrophoresis). Students engage in discussion 
of the paper and are guided by worksheets provided by the 
Instructor (Supporting File S10. Dog Genetics âÃÃ¬ Cadieu et al. 
Discussion). For instance, discussion of the paper starts with 
understanding the primary objective and general methodology 
of the research presented and then transitions to specific 
methodology and results for each gene. The discussions are 
complemented by scaffolded homework (pre- and post-lesson 
worksheets) that integrates analysis of the scientific paper 
with understanding methodology and studentsâÃÃ´ experimental 
results from their analyzed dogs.
We emphasize the value of record keeping in our 
introductory biology laboratory course, since scientists, health 
professionals, and teachers will be required to keep records 
of their experiments, patients, or students. Our students keep 
records by maintaining lab notebooks. Lab notebooks are 
required to include the following elements: date, experiment 
title, group membersâÃÃ´ names, purpose of experiment, data, 
sample identification numbers, calculations, figures/tables, 
results, and conclusions. Students also answer questions that 
are embedded in some of the lessons in their lab notebooks. 
Lab notebooks are informally scanned by instructors during the 
lab times to verify students are recording relevant information, 
data, and activities. At the end of the module, lab notebooks 
are formally assessed by grading selected elements from each 
lesson. Each student lab notebook is evaluated on the same 
elements that are listed on a grading rubric (Supporting File 
S6. Dog Genetics âÃÃ¬ Lab Notebook Grading Rubric), and each 
element appears at least twice on the grading rubric. This 
method of evaluating selected criteria is an effective grading 
strategy because we can give specific, informative feedback 
without grading the entire lab notebook.
Students are given a summative assessment at the end of 
the module in the form of a quiz (Supporting File S8. Dog 
Genetics âÃÃ¬ Example Quiz Questions). The quiz evaluates 
studentsâÃÃ´ understanding of the first three lessons and the 
Cadieu et al. (2009) paper (1). In our course, students are 
given a quiz at the beginning of Lesson 4 and then work in 
their groups to create a poster summarizing their research and 
results from their two dogs. For most of our students, this is the 
first scientific poster they have made, so we discuss common 
mistakes and discuss expectations described in the grading 
rubric (Supporting File S5. Dog Genetics âÃÃ¬ Lesson 4. Final 
Genotype: Collaborative Poster). Students also investigate and 
present an additional, assigned gene that regulates a different 
aspect of dogsâÃÃ´ phenotypes in a small section of their posters. 
We provide a modifiable PowerPoint template from which 
students design their posters (Supporting File S9. Dog Genetics 
âÃÃ¬ Poster Template).
During the final lesson, students present their results in a 
poster conference that models a professional conference. 
Students take turns asking and answering questions about their 
research during the conference and fill-out a questionnaire 
from this discussion (Supporting File S5. Dog Genetics âÃÃ¬ 
Lesson 4. Final Genotype: Collaborative Poster). Additionally, 
all participants of the conference evaluate the posters and vote 
to determine the best poster. The winning poster receives a 
""best in show"" certificate, ribbon, and prize. Lastly, students 
self-assess their own participation in the group and the 
participation levels of other group members using a standard 
form (Supporting File S7. Dog Genetics âÃÃ¬ Group Evaluation).

biotic factors, etc.), depending on instructor/student interests and available facilities/equipment. Within our modular 
framework, students analyze stomatal densities, photosynthetic and respiratory rates, foliar protein concentrations, and 
growth/allocation patterns. Progressive, weekly analysis of B. rapa responses to high and low CO concentrations allows 
students to apply their findings and make predictions about plant responses in subsequent lessons. After all responses are

Note: Additional, more specific objectives are included with each of 
the four lessons (Supporting Files S1-S4",,"In Class:
In contrast to passive learning, active learning involves 
students directly engaging in activities that shift the 
responsibility of learning from the instructor to the students. 
In this module, students work in small groups (3-4 students) 
throughout the entire module. During collaboration, students 
actively work together as they build scientific skills. In 
addition, students participate in hands-on laboratory activities 
that foster problem-solving and promote the construction of 
new knowledge. Also, students are responsible for actively 
maintaining an accurate, up-to-date lab notebook for the 
duration of the module.
Outside of Class:
Students perform and interpret data analyses and work 
with their small groups. They contribute to their lab notebook 
before each weekâÃÃ´s lesson by preparing a pre-lab section. 
Students also work on collaborative writing with peer review 
outside of class.
",,Paper / report / problem set; Quiz; Worksheet; Other,"lab notebook, peer evaluation, self-assessment","Assessment
Assessments for these modules include data gathered from 
five sources: (1) laboratory notebooks, (2) written lab reports, 
(3) student evaluation of participation of group members 
(Supporting File S7: Group Member Evaluation Form), (4) 
assignments (optional Pre-Lesson Worksheet in Supporting File 
S3: Foliar Protein Lesson), and (5) optional quizzes (Supporting 
File S8: Example Quiz).
First, laboratory notebooks are informally spot-checked to 
make sure that students are actively recording their activities. 
In addition, these notebooks are formally evaluated according 
to a grading rubric (Supporting File S9: Lab Notebook Grading 
Rubric) that assesses students on several key criteria (for criteria, 
see Supporting File S9: Lab Notebook Grading Rubric). Over 
the course of the four labs, each criterion is assessed at least 
two times (for details, see Supporting File S9: Lab Notebook 
Grading Rubric).
Second, students submit collaboratively written lab reports 
that are in the style of a scientific paper. Students have 
opportunities to submit multiple drafts, requiring both self-
revision and peer-revision. Reports are graded according to a 
rubric (Supporting File S10: Collaborative Report Instructions 
and Grading Rubric). All students in a group experience being 
the author of a section and an editor for different sections. 
The grading process and author/editor model can be modified 
as desired to work in any laboratory context (for details, see 
Supporting File S10: Collaborative Report Instructions and 
Grading Rubric).
Third, each student submits a self-assessment that 
characterizes their own participation in the group and 
participation levels of other group members using a standard 
form at the end of each module (Supporting File S7: Group 
Member Evaluation Form). Although research on the value 
of student self-assessments (SSAs) is mixed (39), there is 
evidence linking SSA to enhanced metacognition and 
learning outcomes (39) and increased student motivation 
(40). Fourth, assignments from specific lessons are sometimes 
used as formative assessments. For example, the foliar protein 
lab (Supporting File S3: Foliar Protein Lesson) includes an 
assignment that can be used as a formative assessment. Finally, 
quizzes can be periodically given after each lesson or at the 
end of the module to gauge student understanding (Supporting

",It mentions assessing learning outcomes but I am having trouble finding learning goals,"In this guided inquiry, students investigate hypothesized inhibitory effects
of Eastern Hemlock trees on the establishment of neighboring woody plants.
First, students travel to the study area (Hope College Biology Nature Preserve - a
50 acre parcel of beech-maple ""dune"" forest) and observe spatial distribution
patterns of seedlings that could be explained by competitive inhibition. Following
an hour or so of observations, students collect raw data on the occurrence of
woody seedlings beneath adult Eastern Hemlock vs. neighboring forest patches
under adult American Beech (Fagus grandifolia) and/or Sugar Maple (Acer
saccharus). Class data is pooled, and the entire class performs a paired-samples
t-test which, at our site, shows a significant reduction of woody seedlings
beneath Eastern Hemlock as compared with adjacent sites beneath beech or
maple. Next, students are challenged to design a follow-up field and/or lab
investigation of interest to them (and that we approve) to explore two alternative
hypotheses to explain the initial results. Both hypotheses involve competitive
inhibition, but one hypothesis must invoke some form of allelopathic cause for the
distribution differences, and the second hypothesis must propose a non-
allelopathic mechanism (e.g. light quality and/or availability, differences in soil
chemistry and/or physical characteristics, differences in leaf litter under different
tree canopies, etc.). Students then spend about 3 weeks to collect and analyze
their data, and present their results in an in-class symposium.",,Formative assessment; Paper / report / problem set; Presentation; Summative Assessment; Other,"primary literature reference list, original data","Week 1: Collect initial data and report to instructor, who will compile it for all lab

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

Content Objectives for the opiate mini-cases: 

At the end of case #1, students will be able to:

âÃÂ¢ 
Identify 
symptoms related to opiate overdose.
 

Represent the visual pathway.
âÃÂ¢ 
Describe a treatment that is currently available to 

reverse overdose and be able to describe its action.

âÃÂ¢ 
Discuss how relapse following opiate withdrawal can 

lead to overdose.

âÃÂ¢ 
Diagram one of the mechanisms by which opiate 

receptors control vesicle release
.

âÃÂ¢ 
Explain how opiates regulate GABA release and 

subsequently Dopamine release.

âÃÂ¢ 
Describe the neural pathways that underlie addiction.

At the end of case #2, students will be able to:

âÃÂ¢ 
Describe concepts of tolerance, cross-tolerance, 

dependence, sensitization and desensitization
.

âÃÂ¢ Analyze how cross-tolerance develops in the synapse.

âÃÂ¢ 
Relate the action of cross-tolerance in the synapse to a

dose-response curve.

âÃÂ¢ 
Extrapolate how a change in chemical structure influ-

ences a drugâÃÃ´s ability to pass the blood brain barrier.

âÃÂ¢ 
Predict withdrawal symptoms from a drugâÃÃ´s response.

âÃÂ¢ Compare the types of drugs that might have been 

prescribed to alleviate opiate withdrawal symptoms in 

the early 1900s with drugs used today.

âÃÂ¢ 
Explain why MethadoneâÃÃ´s intensity of response and 

withdrawal make it an ideal replacement drug for 

heroin.

âÃÂ¢ 
Identify a receptor that is not an opioid receptor that 

could desensitize in response to opiate use.

At the end of case #3, students will be able to:

âÃÂ¢ 
Describe how opiate addiction is diagnosed.

âÃÂ¢ Compare and contrast the psychological and 

physiological symptoms of addiction and provide 

examples of both.

âÃÂ¢ 
Explain why opiates have strong potential for 

dependence and abuse.

âÃÂ¢ 
Describe how a drugâÃÃ´s potential for abuse is measured 

in the laboratory and identify a behavioral paradigm 

used to measure this.

âÃÂ¢ Theorize why withdrawal from Cocaine is different from 

Heroin and graph how the intensity of their abstinence 

syndrome might compare.

âÃÂ¢ Give an example for why withdrawal symptoms alone 

cannot fully account for opiate addiction",,"Student groups of 3-5 students were pre-assigned by the

Investigating the neural circuits that give rise to this escape behavior can provide a tractable demonstration of systemslevel neuroscience research for undergraduate laboratories. In this paper, we describe three related hands-on exercises using the grasshopper and affordable technology to bring neurophysiology, neuroethology, and neural computation to life and enhance student understanding and interest. We simplified a looming stimuli procedure using the Backyard Brains SpikerBox bioamplifier, an open-source and low-cost electrophysiology rig, to extracellularly record activity of the descending contralateral movement detector (DCMD) neuron from the grasshopperÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs neck. The DCMD activity underlies the grasshopper's motor responses to looming monocular visual cues and can easily be recorded and analyzed on an open-source iOS oscilloscope app, Spike Recorder. Visual stimuli are presented to the grasshopper by this same mobile application allowing for synchronized recording of stimuli and neural activity. An in-app spikesorting algorithm is described that allows a quick way for students to record, sort, and analyze their data at the bench. We also describe a way for students to export these data to other analysis tools. With the protocol described, students will be able to prepare the grasshopper, find and record from the DCMD neuron, and visualize the DCMD responses to quantitatively investigate the escape system by adjusting the speed and size of simulated approaching objects. We describe the results from 22 grasshoppers, where 50 of the 57 recording sessions (87.7%) had a reliable DCMD response.

During the Fall 2016 semester, students in the MCB81

We present three exercises for undergraduate labs: 1)
Recording of DCMD signals when the grasshopper is 
exposed to approaching visual stimuli, 2) Finding the 
minimal inter-trial interval, meaning the minimum amount of 
time that is required between the presentation of the last 
visual stimuli trial and the subsequent trial (durations shorter 
than this minimum result in the grasshopper habituating to 
the repetition of presented stimuli and a substantial 
reduction in the DCMD responses), and 3) Testing the effect 
of visibility of the stimulus on DCMD response by adjusting 
screen brightness and therefore stimulus contrast against 
the background
. 
These lab exercises are designed to guide 
students from an observational question like ""why are 
grasshoppers hard to catch?"" to quantifiable questions 
regarding the visual detection of dangerous objects using 
electrophysiology. Students can investigate the electrical 
transmission of highly processed visual information for this 
life-saving ""see-and-jump"" escape mechanism
. 
Each 
exercise is estimated to take about two hours total, one for 
the animal preparation and another for the 
electrophysiological recording and data analysis, which can 
also be done as homework if necessary
. ",1 class/lab period,,,No,,No Hits,,No,,Yes,,"Exercise 1: Looming Stimuli DCMD Experiments (1hr)
Objective: This exercise, coupled with instructorsâÃÃ´ lectures 
and introduction to neuroanatomy of the grasshopper visual-
motor system, demonstrates to students how sensory input 
might stimulate a dedicated neuronal system to drive a 
certain animal behavior

Exercise 2: Inter-trial Interval Experiments (15min)
Objective: In this exercise, students will be exposed to the 
concept of inter-trial intervals (ITIs), the time between the 
stimuli presentations

Exercise 3: Screen Brightness Experiments (30min)
Objective: This exercise aims to engage students in further 
experimental inquiry after they have performed the previous 
two activities
. 
From a neuronal perspective, contrast of the 
stimuli against the background is important for the DCMD 
response, as it shows that the neuron is encoded to respond 
to particular stimuli depending on the environmental 
conditions

Here, they can hypothesize and test the effect 
of screen brightness, which affects the contrast intensity and 
thus visibility of the black stimuli against the white 
background, on DCMD response

Can the grasshoppers 
effectively see a darken screen? 
Would there be a 
difference in DCMD activity and/or the time at which it 
peaks?",These aren't the well-defined learning objectives one might want to see.,"Exercise 1: Looming Stimuli DCMD Experiments (1hr)
Objective: This exercise, coupled with instructorsâÃÃ´ lectures 
and introduction to neuroanatomy of the grasshopper visual-
motor system, demonstrates to students how sensory input 
might stimulate a dedicated neuronal system to drive a 
certain animal behavior
. 
Students can follow the procedure 
below, with modifications appropriate for a classroom lab or 
other learning settings
. 
Experiments can begin after 
students develop their own hypotheses, regarding the time 
in which the DCMD neuron would peak in the firing 
frequency when the object approaches the grasshopperâÃÃ´s 
eye, or how different object sizes and velocities may affect 
this DCMD firing response
. 
For example, we might expect 
the DCMD firing to increase and peak before the virtual 
object would collide with the grasshopperâÃÃ´s eye
. 
This would 
ensure a successful jump away from danger
. 
What would 
we observe with objects of different sizes and approaching 
at different speeds?
Procedure: In the SpikeRecorder application, keep the 
following parameters constant: 10cm distance between the 
grasshopperâÃÃ´s eye and the iPad and inter-trial intervals, ITI, 
of 45s to reduce habituation of the DCMD response to visual 
stimuli
. 
For the required values of choice for S (object 
radius) and v (object approaching velocity), we suggest 
choosing S of 6cm and a range of v values (-2, -4, -6, -8m/s) 
to begin
. 
Each combination of S and v should be repeated 
for at least three simulation trials
. 
Such parameters will 
create an experiment, approximately 10 minutes in duration, 
that allows students to observe the differences in DCMD 
response to objects of the same size but approaching at 
different velocities
. 
Once the application is set up, check 
again for the correct iPad positioning and connected cables 
as described above and press âÃÃ²StartâÃÃ´ in the iPad app to 
begin
. 
Observe the approach of the black dots and listen for 
DCMD spikes in form of popcorn popping sounds through 
the speakers.
Exercise 2: Inter-trial Interval Experiments (15min)
Objective: In this exercise, students will be exposed to the 
concept of inter-trial intervals (ITIs), the time between the 
stimuli presentations. ITI times are often important in 
behavior studies, as subjects may need a fixed amount of 
time to respond to the next stimuli
. 
This is indeed the case 
in DCMD experiments (Rind and 
Simmons, 1992; 
Hatsopoulos et al., 1995)
. 
ITIs ensure that each trialâÃÃ´s 
stimulus is distinct and thus the animal would not develop 
habituation to the presented stimuli, preventing accurate 
DCMD responses
. 
Instructors can discuss the use of ITIs of 
at least 40s used in literature (e.g.
, 
Rind and Simmons, 
1992)
. 
Students can hypothesize the effect of different ITIs 
on peak DCMD activity, such as an marked decrease in 
bursting activity when there is no ITI, a short ITI (less than 
10s) or a medium ITI (20s)
. 
Students can subsequently 
implement an experiment to investigate their predictions, 
and determine a sufficiently long interval to avoid habituation 
to the stimuli.
Procedure: With the same setup as Exercise 1, enter 
parameters to be kept constant for this experiment in the 
application: 10cm distance between eye and iPad, chosen 
number of trials per ITI, and one pair of S and v values
. 
We 
recommend using three different ITIs, repeating each at 
least three times, to produce distinctly different DCMD 
responses: 45s, 22.5s, and 1s
. 
This recording should take 
approximately 10-15 minutes.
Exercise 3: Screen Brightness Experiments (30min)
Objective: This exercise aims to engage students in further 
experimental inquiry after they have performed the previous 
two activities
. 
From a neuronal perspective, contrast of the 
stimuli against the background is important for the DCMD 
response, as it shows that the neuron is encoded to respond 
to particular stimuli depending on the environmental 
conditions
. 
Here, they can hypothesize and test the effect 
of screen brightness, which affects the contrast intensity and 
thus visibility of the black stimuli against the white 
background, on DCMD response
. 
Can the grasshoppers 
effectively see a darken screen? 
Would there be a 
difference in DCMD activity and/or the time at which it 
peaks?
Procedure: Adjust brightness of the screen in the Settings 
of the iPad, whose brightness is approximately 425 cd/m2 
at maximum and 5 cd/m2 at minimum
. 
Constant parameters 
include 10cm distance between eye and iPad, 45s ITI, 
number of trials per brightness level, and one pair of S and 
v values
. 
Students may choose different brightness levels, 
each is a separate experiment
. 
We recommend initially 
observing the effects of the maximum and minimum screen 
brightness levels (the iPad screen will not be completely 
black at the minimum setting, but very dim)
. 
If ten 
stimulation trials are chosen for each brightness level, the 
recording for each brightness level should take about 10 
minutes.
Data Analysis
The SpikeRecorder app includes spike sorting, data 
analysis and visualization functionality
. 
DCMD activity and 
change in angular size of the visual stimulus over time can 
be visualized in perievent time histograms or PETHs (peri-
stimulus time histograms, see Bretschneider and De Weille, 
2006 for a review) and raster plots, with time of collision 
defined as the 0 second point
. 
Students may save the data 
graphs directly from the app or engage in deeper analysis 
for a post-lab assignment.
 
For more in-depth analysis, data recorded and contained 
within the SpikeRecorder application can be exported to 
JSON files, which can then be imported into MATLAB 
(MathWorks, Inc.) using the open-source JSONlab toolbox
. 
The MATLAB code files are available for download from the 
Backyard Brains GitHub repository (see Supplementary 
Information)
. 
A database of the experimental data 
(recording and spike timestamps, stimulus angles, time of 
collision) will be created by the provided code

Perievent 
time histograms and raster plots can then be plotted to

Direct Assessment 
The Mysterious Case of Patient X has been taught four 
semesters. 
Direct measures of student learning were 
assessed through classroom participation, assignments 
and exams. Homework assignments were checked at the 
beginning of class but not collected until the end, in order 
to facilitate class participation. Students notes added to 
the assignment during class were to be clearly indicated. 
 
The exam format was adjusted each year to 
accommodate modifications in the overall structure of the 
course. In Spring 2017, the ParkinsonâÃÃ´s unit was assessed 
with a take-home exam that asked students to develop a 
hypothesis and design an experiment emphasizing 
material covered beyond the case study. Sample data 
from the three semesters that were assessed with an in-
class exam is shown in Table 1. These exams served as 
the primary means of assessing learning outcomes. They 
included multiple choice, short answer, and, in some 
cases, an essay question. Students consistently did very 
well on multiple choice questions. 
Not surprisingly, 
students did better in small classes with less than 10 
students than in the larger class with 28 students. 
However, in all cases, students performed well above the 
proficient level, defined as 80%. 
 
Student self-assessment was performed through both a 
structured survey and an open-ended three-minute 
reflection. Prior to this unit, the course used two major 
case studies making it impossible in most cases to 
determine the relative contribution of The Mysterious Case 
of Patient X to their responses. The prior cases relied on a 
problem-based learning approach exemplified by Professor 
Eric CanâÃÃ´t See: A Project-Based Learning Case For 
Neurobiology Students (Ogilvie & Ribbens, 2016). 
Nevertheless, some student responses were specific to 
this case and, since it was taught at the end of the 
semester, it was likely to bias their responses. 
Indirect Assessment 
In 2019, students were given both a pre- and post-
assessment survey (Fig 1). At the beginning of the 
semester, students rated their level of experience critically 
evaluating information in the popular press or internet 
about neurobiological disorders. On a scale of 1 (no 
experience) to 5 (extensive experience), the average self-
assessment was 3.1 Â¬Â± 0.98. On the post-assessment 
survey, students rated how much learning they gained for 
this element on a scale of 1 (no gain) to 5 (very large gain). 

The average score was 4.2 Â¬Â± 0.88, with 100% of the 
students indicating some level of gain and 78% indicating 
large or very large gain. 
In the pre-assessment survey, 
students rated their level of experience actively 
participating in class discussion with an average score of 
3.8 Â¬Â± 0.81. In spite of this strong response, students 
indicated that they had moderate to large gain (3.5 Â¬Â± 1.13) 
with 29% of the students indicating very large gain. Using 
the 
Likert 
scale 
(1 
= 
strongly 
disagree; 5 = strongly agree), students also rated their 
level of agreement with the statement: I gained knowledge 
by learning from my classmates and/or by explaining to 
them. Notably, 89% of students agreed or strongly agreed 
Figure 1. A. Pre-assessment survey asked students to rate their 
experience on a scale from no experience (1) to extensive 
experience (5). B. For the first two items, students were asked on 
a post-assessment survey to rate how much experience they 
gained on a scale from no gain (1) to very large gain (5). For the 
third item, students were asked to rate their agreement with the 
statement on a scale from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree 
(5). 
with this statement (4.33 Â¬Â± 0.78). 
 
Finally, students were given the following question for a 
three-minute reflection: ""What is the most interesting 
knowledge you have gained in this class? Why?"" Box 1 
includes sample responses. Many students commented 
here and in the university course evaluation that they 
expected to hate the collaborative learning approach in the 
class and were surprised to discover how much they loved 
it, consistent with their responses on the post-assessment 
survey. Students found The Mysterious Case of Patient X 
to be ""challenging and engaging."" Students also 
appreciated that this was a real case of a well-known 
individual. Overall, the self-report data support student 
fulfillment of the process objectives. ",,Yes,Provided or described in detail in article text; Email an author/journal,"""Student materials and

I used a writing assignment successfully over 20 years in a one-term invertebrate biology course, despite enrolments exceeding 100. Structured to maximally engage students yet minimize marking load, the assignment often yielded gems of stories for use in subsequent lectures.

Students liked this assignment because they could choose any aspect of the biology of any invertebrate genus. This inspired them to explore the literature out of personal interest. It's appealing for instructors, because annotations are compact and therefore easy to read, mark, and inspect for plagiarism. It is appealing to host universities, because it generates extensive use of library resources and motivates students to learn how to use them, and online taxonomic databases, effectively.

differentiating content and lesson material to reach all types 
of learners. The hands-on activities of this module capture the 
attention and engagement of kinesthetic and tactile learners. 
Our short lectures that contain images, provide written 
instruction, and facilitate discussion amongst the class are 
accommodating to both visual and auditory learners. Given 
that Stony Brook University consists of a highly diverse 
population of students, during group activities, we can easily 
divide our class into diversified groups at random using a 
freely available random name picking software called 
. We highly recommend that instructors utilize this tool 
given that it avoids any self-selection or instructor selection 
biases.
To ensure that students feel welcomed, we establish 
classroom ""etiquette"", similar to that suggested by Tanner 
2013, where we emphasize that all students are expected to 
support one another and share their ideas in a judgement free 
manner (36). On the first day of class, we implemented an ice-
breaker activity, called ""catch the ball"", where all students and 
faculty ""threw"" around an imaginary ball to one another, and 
those who ""caught"" the ball on a turn introduced themselves, 
shared their interests, hobbies, and goals. We suggest a similar 
activity be implemented during the start of the course so that 
instructors can familiarize themselves with their students. To 
further create an inclusive learning environment, we ensure 
that all students have the means to be successful in the 
module. We ensure class material for the lesson is posted on 
Blackboard and/or in Google Drive in a timely fashion so that 
students can access it prior to the start of class and afterwards. 
For students who may not have equal access to technology, we 
provide hard copies, as well as digital copies, of assignments 
and lab protocols. We also hold office hours on request and 
have discussion boards available so everybody can benefit 
from each otherâÃÃ´s questions and/or discussions. Moreover, 
based on information obtained from class assessments (see

throughout this module include a modified think-pair-share 
exercise, clicker polling questions, and a peer review activity. 
Students are asked a series of clicker polling questions 
during the RNAi lecture that focus on studentsâÃÃ´ conceptual 
understanding of RNAi (Supporting File S1. A Laboratory 
Module âÃÃ¬ GFP RNAi C. elegans Lecture). For the modified 
think-pair-share exercise, prior to the GFP RNAi experiment, 
students are assigned a GFP RNAi worksheet to work on 
independently at home (Think component) (Supporting File 
S5. A Laboratory Module âÃÃ¬ Student GFP RNAi Worksheet). 
In brief, the worksheet contains a series of questions that 
promote independent thinking about the RNAi experiment 
and guide the students in formulating their hypothesis (see 
below). After completing the worksheet at home, students form 
into groups during their next lab session (Pair component), 
and while preparing for the GFP RNAi experiment, they are 
encouraged to discuss amongst themselves their findings and 
share their hypotheses. When conducting the experiment 
in class, instructors, and teaching assistants approach each 
group and ask them to share their findings from the worksheet 
(Modified share component). This is followed by a series of 
additional questions asked by the instructor(s) to further test 
their understanding of RNAi (Supporting File S3. A Laboratory 
Module âÃÃ¬ GFP RNAi Module Worksheet Discussion Questions 
& Answers). This modified share component of the think-pair-
share activity provides an equitable opportunity for all groups 
to validate their understanding rather than a select few groups 
sharing in front of the entire class (33).
For the peer review activity, after completing their lab 
report assignment (Supporting File S2. A Laboratory Module 
âÃÃ¬ Grading Rubric and Example Lab Report), students are 
randomly assigned to review and constructively critique 
another fellow studentâÃÃ´s laboratory report. Students are first 
instructed to upload their lab reports into their designated 
Google Drive folder as a Google document (.docx file), 
which allows their peer reviewer to easily comment on the 
reports in real-time and create editable suggestions. Each peer 
reviewer is instructed to provide feedback and suggestions on 
the required components of their lab report (i.e., Nucleotide 
alignment figure, data table of quantification, etc.; See 
Supporting File S2. A Laboratory Module âÃÃ¬ Grading Rubric 
and Example Lab Report). Specifically, each student must 
review each otherâÃÃ´s work with specific criteria in mind, such 
as the clarity of writing (Is a hypothesis clearly stated and is 
there enough detail to understand the results?), statistical tests 
performed (Are appropriate statistical tests performed on the 
data?), and organization of data (Is the data organized in such 
a way that results can be clearly interpreted?). We emphasized 
to the students that all critiques should be professional and 
constructive and should avoid any condescending language. 
The purpose of this assignment is to get students to become 
familiar with the scientific process of peer review, appreciate 
the importance of quality work in delivering a clear message 
and encourage the exchange of ideas. Most importantly, peer 
review as an active learning strategy stimulates students to 
reflect on their own written work, and results in improvements 
on their own writing (34, 35).",,Formative assessment; Paper / report / problem set; Data (hand in a dataset and/or figure); Other,peer review activity,"Student assessments are conducted at multiple levels 
throughout the module. During the short introductory lectures, 
students are asked a series of clicker polling questions 
incorporated into the lecture (Supporting File S1. A Laboratory 
Module âÃÃ¬ GFP RNAi C. elegans Lecture) and are informally 
assessed based on whether their answers are correct or 
incorrect. We also informally assess students on their ability to 
provide constructive feedback during the peer-mediated review 
activity (see above), which counts as part of their participation 
grade, as well as their ability to answer questions asked by 
instructors during the modified think-pair-share activity 
(Supporting File S3. A Laboratory Module âÃÃ¬ GFP RNAi Module

not require students to submit a lab notebook for the course, 
each class section receives a Google Drive folder, in which 
students are encouraged to upload their quantified data and 
any observations made into their individualized sub-folders. 
We also ask them to submit their completed lab report into 
their individualized sub-folder as a Google doc for grading by 
instructors and teaching assistants. Along these lines, students 
are formally graded based on the quality of their lab report 
assignment, which includes a graph and table of their results,

methods and concerns that enter into estimating species richness in the field. 
The instructor will briefly review these points at the start of lab with a particular 
discussion of the terms ""estimate"" and ""sample"" and then summarize the actual 
procedures to follow in the field. Upon arrival at the field site, the students will 
briefly review field identification of the tree species present, and then work in 
teams of 3-4 to identify and count tree species in plots and along transects. 
These data will be combined by the instructor with data from other teams and 
then returned to the students for analysis. Finally, students will individually 
compute their estimates of local species richness, using species accumulation 
curves and total species estimators, based both on their own teamâÃÃ´s data and

Students will be assessed on their successful collection of data in the field by 
submitting their teamâÃÃ´s data to the lab instructor at the end of the exercise. 
Students will also be assessed individually based on their subsequent 
calculation, assessment and analysis of species richness, using both their teamâÃÃ´s 
data and that from the whole class (see sample data sheet). They will also be 
assessed individually on their responses to the questions for further thought and 
discussion that are listed at the end of the lab handout. The instructor may 
assign students additional work if desired, such as a literature review of methods 
or issues surrounding the estimation of species richness. This provides not only 
an opportunity to develop the studentsâÃÃ´ scientific writing skills.",,Yes,"Provided or described in detail in article text; Cited as supplemental materials, supporting materials, or in an appendix",,Easy,

Using a novel framework, remote Microbial Ecology CURE students used microbes isolated via antimicrobial-challenged Winogradsky columns to investigate phylogeny and metabolism through a hypothesis-driven meta-analysis (MA). Students used 16S rRNA and key metabolic enzymes to compare phylogeny; enzymes were modeled and evaluated for putative conserved domains, culminating in primer design and analysis. Using in silico tools facilitated student development of bioinformatics skills. The MA was subdivided into discrete sections in order to (i) provide a timeline for students to remain on schedule throughout a remote-learning lab experience, (ii) encourage feedback throughout the project, and (iii) facilitate student understanding of the experimental design. MA deliverables were designed to be specific figures with individual titles, legends, and analyses to enable their feedback for subsequent presentations. The six key formative deliverables included a word cloud (used to develop the works cited list and hypothesis), a 16S rRNA phylogenetic tree, an annotated metabolic pathway and three-dimensional model of the key metabolic enzyme, a phylogenetic tree based on the key metabolic enzyme, design and analysis of a primer set for the key metabolic enzyme, and a summative poster and graphical abstract.

engagement and support of all students, regardless of level of 
preparation. The topic links easily to daily life, and students 
were encouraged to pursue ideas that were interesting to them 
and to bring materials from their home to test. Structure with 
clear goals and support has been shown to particularly improve 
learning in students belonging to groups underrepresented in 
the sciences (26-28). To this end, the goals of achieving mastery 
in the different science processes in order to prepare them for 
future classes and careers were explicitly stated to students at 
the start of the semester (including in the syllabus, Supporting 
File S1. Bioactive Compounds âÃÃ¬ Syllabus) and when transitioning 
between modules. That learning is a process and that skills build 
over time was also explicitly stated to the students in every lab 
session. The emphasis on growth was enacted in every class 
where students were provided with support and sufficient in-class 
time to plan their experiment, to learn to use Excel, to make 
a graph, to perform statistical analysis, and to write up their 
work as a lab report and to prepare their presentation. The lab 
report was guided with built-in instructions for the individual 
elements (e.g., Supporting File S12. Bioactive compounds âÃÃ¬ 
Module 1. Lab 4. Guided lab report). Students had time to work 
on different parts of the lab report during class over several 
weeks. Information needed to complete a task was provided 
before class as part of homework assignments. Sessions started 
with a whole class discussion of daily tasks from the homework, 
followed by demonstration of any laboratory techniques. All 
assignments were considered formative: students were given 
feedback on how they might improve their work and then given 
the opportunity to make said improvements. Since they used 
the same or similar skills over the course of the four modules, 
students had the opportunity to grow their skills and improve 
throughout the semester âÃÃ¬ and explicitly recognize that in self-
reflections.
Group work was also structured to support the success 
of all students centering around the principles of positive 
interdependence, individual accountability, and equal and 
simultaneous interaction (29). Students were individually 
accountable by completing their own individual assignments 
that prepared them for a class session or as they learned new 
skills during class. Being individually accountable at every stage 
of the research process prepared students to participate equally 
and productively during group interactions. Group work relied 
on positive interdependence, as students needed each other 
both for the overall success of the project as well as for tasks 
that were complicated enough to elicit mutual need (29-31). 
Specifically, students worked in groups of four for cognitively 
difficult tasks that benefit from multiple inputs such as planning 
the experiment or discussing experimental results. For performing 
the experiment or recording the results, students worked in 
smaller groups of two to allow both students to be fully engaged. 
For example, often both students worked on the experiment 
together, while in other cases the two students had specific, 
complementary tasks of either completing or recording results.
Successful group interactions in this Lesson were also supported 
by clear goals, tasks being highly relevant to the goal, and 
outcomes in the form of lab reports or presentations with multiple 
parts that clearly linked to future value in their science careers 
(31). Active learning in general has been shown to support 
inclusive learning by all students (32). CUREs implemented 
early in the curriculum have been shown to improve scientific 
self-efficacy, identity, and student persistence in STEM degrees 
among diverse students (11,33) and hold particular promise for 
underrepresented minority students (33-35).",,,Yes,,Yes,,"
Learning Goals
The overarching learning goal is for students to understand more 
accurately and deeply the scientific process of making inferences 
from data to answer biological questions and make sense of the world 
around us. To this end, students will experience for themselves the 
realities of authentic scientific investigation in three experiments. 
Specifically, they will learn to conduct scientific investigations 
employing a wide range of scientific practices by making their own 
experimental choices, using methods for rigorous analysis and careful 
interpretation of data, and presenting their experiments in oral and 
written form. Students will also be able to describe the advantages 
and disadvantages of three different experimental systems to answer 
the same kind of question. Students will develop a plan for an 
ecologically-sound habitat to address a current ecological problem 
and gain an appreciation for the web of complex and mutually 
dependent interactions that connect living organisms on Earth.

team discussions and reporting out to the rest of class were used 
repeatedly in every class. For each of the four modules, students 
were presented with an experimental design ""challenge"" and 
then worked in their team to discuss and decide on different 
options in response to the challenge, to include both the choice 
of substance to test and the experimental procedure. They 
perform the first experiment and analyze the results. Students 
then consider the results from the first experiment and reflect 
on any technical issues that were encountered to make their 
own decisions on what changes to make for the second iteration 
of the experiment. When individual students had performed 
literature research on a topic, they would have to advocate for 
their choices based on the literature to their classmates. Students

Learning Goal(s)
âÃÂ¢ Students should understand how different types of mutations affect 
alleles, and the corresponding mRNAs and proteins.
âÃÂ¢ Students should understand how genetic information is expressed, 
and how changes in DNA can affect an organismâÃÃ´s phenotype. 
Learning Objective(s)
Students will be able to:
âÃÂ¢ explain the differences between silent (no change in the resulting 
amino acid sequence), missense (a change in the amino acid 
sequence), and nonsense (a change resulting in a premature stop 
codon) mutations.
âÃÂ¢ differentiate between how information is encoded during DNA 
replication, transcription, and translation.
âÃÂ¢ evaluate how different types of mutations (silent, missense, and 
nonsense) and the location of those mutations (intron, exon, and 
promoter) differentially affect the processes in the central dogma.
âÃÂ¢ predict the molecular (DNA size, mRNA length, mRNA 
abundance, and protein length) and/or phenotypic consequences 
of mutations.",,"
The activity includes short answer discussion questions and
multiple-choice questions with real-time student participation 
(i.e. clickers questions), think-pair-share (16), and whole class 
discussions. In whole class discussions, dialogue is shared 
across the classroom as the instructor facilitates moving the 
conversation from student to student. This dynamic can be 
achieved with or without clickers. Often a student will answer 
a question posed by the instructor and another student may 
support or disagree with the first student. For example, an 
instructor can request an explanation for a possible answer 
to the multiple-choice clicker question after peer discussion. 
When a student provides an answer, the instructor then asks 
other students to support or disagree with the answer and 
provide evidence. Having multiple students respond directly 
to one another enables students to hear diverse perspectives, 
requires students to verbalize their thoughts for a 
larger 
audience, and provides opportunity for interaction with a 
different subset of peers.",,Formative assessment; Exam; Worksheet; Summative Assessment,,"Assessment of student understanding came from three 
sources: pre and post-activity responses to the AACR stop

7) To improve writing ability to construct and evaluate

We have offered this lab in multiple separate semesters and 
found that it works best to teach it over two laboratory
sessions
. 
In the first session, students practice handling 
individual larvae, moving them quickly between dishes and 
with a minimal amount of liquid transfer to reduce 
contamination of rinse dishes with the FM 1
-43 dye
. 
Practice is also needed for mounting larvae on sides
. 
During 
short lectures at the onset of the laboratories, students learn 
about the information necessary to understand their 
experiments
, 
which includes hair cell structure and function
,
the zebrafish lateral line system, and fundamentals of 
epifluorescence microscopy and fluorescent molecules
. 
A 
brief introduction to the use of FM 1-43 as a measure for 
open mechanotransduction channels is also provided (Gale 
et al., 2001)
. 
Thus the first laboratory session is primarily a 
run-through of the entire method without the use of DHS, 
and the second session requires data collection from control 
and experimental fish, which students complete with more 
efficiency due to the experience gained in the first lab 
session
. 
Students typically work in groups of 2-3, with each 
group labeling and collecting data from both control larvae 
and experimental larvae with a single DHS concentration.
Fluorescent labeling of control larvae
Each group of 2-3 students was given ~10 larval zebrafish
in a petri dish filled with E3-embryo medium at room 
temperature. Using a 1 mL transfer pipette, students 
transferred a single larva into a 50 x 9 mm petri dish 
containing 2 Â¬Âµl of the 1,000x fluorescent dye FM 1-43 diluted 
in 2 mL of E3 medium (Figure 3B). The larva was labeled 
for 30 seconds and then transferred and rinsed 
subsequently in two separate 100 mm petri dishes 
containing E3 medium only (Figure 3C, top). To avoid cross-
contamination of the rinse dishes, laboratory tape of 
different colors was used to match separate pipettes to each 
petri dish. Finally, students placed the larva into a petri dish
containing the anesthetic tricaine (0.016% in E3) for ~2 min 
and verified the absence of a startle response by tapping on 
the side of the dish (Figure 3D). The anesthetized larva was 
transferred with a new pipette into a 50-mL conical tube 
containing low gelling temperature agarose with tricaine. 
Finally, students rapidly removed a small aliquot of low-melt 
agarose containing the larva and deposited both onto a 
depression slide that was immediately covered with a glass 
coverslip (Figure 3E). The ideal position of the larva is on 
its left or right side, however head neuromasts can still be 
imaged if the larva is not in this position. After waiting ~5 
min for the agarose to solidify, the mounted larva was ready 
for fluorescent imaging (see below). Performing the last 
step expediently was important to guarantee appropriate 
mounting of the larva onto the microscope slide. FM 1-43 
solutions and dishes should be protected from light when not 
in use, perhaps using tin foil over the petri dish lids.
Fluorescent labeling of experimental larvae
To assay the dose-dependent DHS block of the MET 
channel, the experimental larvae were fluorescently labeled 
with FM 1-43 in the presence of a range of DHS 
concentrations
. 
Each group of students placed a larva into 
a pre-labeling petri dish containing a specific concentration 
of DHS in E3 (Figure 3A, bottom)
. 
Each was responsible for 
one concentration of DHS, with ideally two or more groups 
overlapping on a given concentration
. 
Because ligand 
binding typically follows the Law of Mass Action, the 
following log and half-log concentrations were chosen for 
DHS: 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3 and 10 mM
. 
Students were shown 
that for a Hill equation with slope n = 1
, 
a reduction from 10% 
to 90% of fluorescence will fall within a span of one log unit 
to either side of the IC50
. 
This relationship is shown with
Equation 2 using hypothetical values of 3 mM IC50 (50% 
block) and 0.3 (~10%) and 30 mM 
(~90%) 
DHS 
concentrations
. 
Next, the larva was transferred to the 
labeling dish, which contained 2 Â¬ÂµL of FM 1-43 and 2 mL of 
E3 plus DHS at the experimental concentration (Figure 3B, 
bottom)
. 
It was crucial that all groups worked with a fixed 
volume of E3 and a fixed concentration of FM 1-43
. 
As with 
control larvae, each larva was labeled for exactly 30 
seconds
. 
Rapid transferring of the larva took practice as did 
transferring the larva with a minimum amount of E3+FM 1-
43
. 
After labeling, each larva was rinsed in E3 solutions that 
also contained the experimental concentration of DHS to 
avoid labeling of unblocked hair cells by contaminating FM 
1-43 (Figure 3C, bottom)
. 
The anesthesia and mounting 
steps followed the same procedure as described for control 
larvae (see Figs
. 
3D and E).
Visualization: Hair Cells and Fluorescent Imaging
Students placed the depression slide with the mounted larva 
on an upright, epifluorescence microscope equipped with a 
GFP/FITC filter set
. 
Students first observed the larva under 
transmitted light with the 10x and 40x objectives
. 
Initially, 
they noted the major organs of the larva, including the eyes, 
ears, olfactory pits, heart and circulatory system and lateral 
line system
. 
After a neuromast of the anterior or posterior 
lateral line system was identified under transmitted light (see 
Ghysen and Dambly-ChaudiâÂ®re, 2004; Chitnis et al., 2012 
for review of lateral line system in zebrafish larvae), students 
observed the hair cells under fluorescence illumination
. 
Bright field and fluorescence images of three different 
neuromasts at different focal planes were taken using the 
SPOT software and an 8-bit digital camera (Figure 4)
. 
The 
students were instructed to select the exposure time and 
gain manually with settings that resulted in the clearest 
image and to hold these settings constant for all subsequent 
images for both their control and experimental conditions. It 
is critical that pixel intensity in captured images is not 
saturated as linear changes in fluorescence intensity would 
be lost. Similarly, it is very important that camera settings 
are not changed throughout the experiment. Students 
should be shown how to check for saturation using the 
camera software and perhaps also within the ImageJ 
software. Also, control labeling and imaging should be 
performed first because these images will be brighter and 
allow the camera settings to be optimized to the brightest 
images. These points can be highlighted on the laboratory 
handout as well as during the instructorâÃÃ´s pre-lab lecture.
 
We also note that depending on the number of available
microscopes, lab sessions can be staggered to have
students arrive in groups to minimize students waiting to use
the microscope(s)
. 
The process from labeling through to 
imaging can be completed within an hour if necessary, with 
analysis and discussion happening offline or during another 
class or lab session
.
 
The collected images were analyzed using ImageJ
. 
A 
region of interest (ROI) was drawn around each neuromast 
using the circle outline tool
. 
It was important to minimize the 
amount of background surrounding the neuromast included 
in the ROI, which would otherwise bias the mean pixel 
intensity
. 
Under Analyze>Tools>ROI Manager, the students 
clicked on ""Add [t]"" and used the ""Measure"" option to obtain 
the mean pixel intensity for the ROI as computed by the 
program. Students carried out this process for neuromasts 
from both control and experimental larvae
. 
In future 
iterations of this lab, it would be beneficial to subtract 
background fluorescence by measuring an ROI in a non-hair 
cell region of the image, which would reduce the potential 
confounding effect of certain ROIs containing more 
background area than others.
Data Analysis
Each group used IgorPro or another comparable data 
analysis and spreadsheet program to average the mean 
intensities of the three or more neuromasts imaged from 
each control and each experimental larva
. 
The average 
fluorescence intensity reduction was determined from the 
following equation:
Equation 3. 
% reduction = 100 âÃ³ (ï£¿Ã¹ÃªÂºï£¿Ã¹ÃªÂº0 âÃ Ã­ ï£¿Ã¹ÃªÂºï£¿Ã¹ÃªÂº
ï£¿Ã¹Ã«â¢ï£¿Ã¹Ã«â¢
)/ï£¿Ã¹ÃªÂºï£¿Ã¹ÃªÂº0
where I0 is the value of the control fluorescence intensity and 
IX is the experimental fluorescence intensity for each 
concentration of DHS tested
. 
Normalizing the data obtained 
from each group accounted for differences in microscopes, 
camera settings, and individual technique
. 
The students 
then entered their individual data in a Google Docs sheet so 
that every student had access to fluorescence 
measurements taken under every concentration of DHS
. 
The mean percent reduction in fluorescence for each DHS 
concentration was plotted against the concentration of DHS 
with the X-axis set to a log scale (Figure 5). Students were
asked to fit the Hill equation (Equation 2) to their plot of the 
data and calculate the IC50 value. Finally, the students were
given the freedom to choose their own approach to
manipulating the curve and presenting their hypothesis and
results in the context of a biologically relevant research 
question
. 
The format of the lab report was chosen to be a 
scientific paper as described in the Background section.",,Paper / report / problem set; Other,Survey (self report),"Student Evaluation
To evaluate whether the laboratory was successful in 
achieving the above stated learning objectives, the following 
survey was given to the class of students in the fall of 2016:
Please evaluate from 1 to 5 how effective the zebrafish MET 
channel lab was in accomplishing each of the following 
statements:
 
(1 = not at all effective and 5 = very effective)
.
1) Teaching me about the structure and function of MET 
channels
2) Teaching me about the pharmacology of pore blocking 
molecules, ligand-receptor interactions, dose-
dependent relationships, and the Hill equation
3) Teaching me about fluorescent dyes and 
epifluorescence microscopy (excitation and emission 
filters and dichroic mirrors
, 
etc.)
4) Teaching me how to capture and quantify microscopic 
images using an epifluorescence microscope with a 
digital camera
5) Teaching me about the zebrafish model organism 
including hands-on experimentation with larvae
6) Improving my research abilities including collection and 
analysis of data, constructing figures and presenting 
results in the form of manuscript-style lab reports

RESULTS
Classroom Results
Students successfully labeled hair cells from lateral line 
neuromasts with FM 1-43 in both control (without DHS) and 
experimental (in the presence of a fixed concentration of 
DHS) larvae
. 
Images captured by students demonstrated 
that control neuromasts (Figure 4A) appeared to have 
brighter fluorescence than those treated with DHS (Figure
4B)
. 
After photographing and analyzing control and 
experimental neuromasts, students calculated the percent 
reduction in fluorescence between experimental and control 
neuromasts
. 
They then plotted these data against the 
concentrations of DHS and generated dose-response 
curves
. 
Some students chose to fit their data to the Hill 
equation by hand using a large column of incrementing X 
values and solving for intensity (I) values based on 
estimated parameter values for IC50 and Hill slope (n), while 
others used a curve fitting program
. 
This decision was 
based mostly on the level of math and computer science 
courses that students have taken.
 
Figure 5 shows example graphs generated by students, 
both of which include the recorded data and an attempt at 
fitting the data with the Hill equation. Both of the curves 
have a sigmoidal shape, and the bulk of the fluorescence 
reduction (~10-90%) takes place within two log units 
surrounding the predicted IC50 value that each student 
calculated. As mentioned in the Methods section, this 
finding indicates that the Hill slope is likely to be around n = 
1. For these data, the students found that saturating DHS 
decreased fluorescence by a maximum of 60%, and the top 
plot shows normalized percent reduction values using this 
percentage as the ""maximum"" reduction. The result of a 
60% max reduction rather than a complete 100% loss of 
fluorescence may be due to multiple sources of 
experimental error, including transfer of FM dye into the 
rinse steps. Using a normalized maximal fluorescence 
intensity allows the students to fit to the Hill equation, which 
assumes 100% effect. Students were encouraged to 
discuss these sources of error in their lab reports. The data 
shown in Figure 5A were fit to both a Hill equation with n = 
1 (shown in red) and n = 2 (shown in green). The quality of 
fit of the Hill equation with a slope of 1 allowed the student 
to conclude that DHS appeared to bind to MET channels in 
a one to one manner. In contrast, the student that created 
the plot shown in Figure 5B chose to not normalize the 
percent reduction to 100% and to fit with only n=1. 
Ultimately, students were given the freedom to interpret their 
data and draw their own conclusions in their individual lab 
reports.
Student Evaluation Results
Sixteen students out of the twenty that participated in the 
Fall 2016 laboratory exercises responded to the survey 
described in the above Student Evaluation section. In the 
survey, students ranked the extent that the laboratory had 
been successful in their achievement of each learning 
objective (these results are summarized in Figure 6). For all 
of the learning objectives, a majority of students reported 
either a 4 or 5, and no student reported a score below 3 for 
any objective. Objective 4, ""to gain experience capturing
and quantifying microscopic images using an epifluorescent 
while objective 2, ""to learn about the pharmacology of pore 
blocking molecules, ligand-receptor interactions, dose-
dependent relationships, and the Hill equation,"" had the

of this tutorial in an experimental undergraduate course in 
bioinformatics at a small liberal arts school (Juniata College). 
This course included sophomore, junior, and senior biology 
majors, all of whom had taken at least two other biology 
courses. In the discussion, we describe some alternative 
implementations. This tutorial will likely work best in a lab 
section or class sessions with no more than 10 to 15 students

genome biology, the specific student backgrounds are 
flexible. Brief comments within the text and links to further 
information serve as starting points for in-class lectures and 
discussions (such as those included in the online repository 
with the tutorial), rather than ends unto themselves. In this 
way, the tutorial can be geared to match student needs. These 
differences may be related to student background (e.g., a 100

This deficiency increases the value of engaging undergraduates

with instructor guidance available when they hit problems. 
Additional instruction, such as lectures or discussions on the 
underlying biology, may be necessary, but the primary learning 
goals of each chapter are actively explored and accomplished 
directly by the student. In addition, students will troubleshoot 
problems as they arise, particularly when a second student 
encounters similar errors. These troubleshooting steps are not 
intentionally inserted, but students tend to make small errors 
when running the commands that cause errors until they are 
identified.
Also contributing to active learning, student peers help 
with the troubleshooting process, which appeared to help 
both the helper and the struggling student to learn in more 
depth. Instructors, particularly in larger classes, may wish 
to formalize this teamwork approach using the ""Jigsaw"" 
technique [25], which stresses the individual contribution of 
each team member to a larger goal. This approach may also 
alleviate the load on instructors in larger classes. Finally, 
the entire analysis, from raw sequence data to downstream 
interpretation, is carried out directly by the students, creating 
substantial buy-in and individual investment. This buy in can 
be further increased by utilizing data for a research question

homework, syllabus, and reports âÃÃ¬ were structured primarily 
around the concepts being taught alongside the tutorial, but 
competencies students developed in the tutorial were used to 
answer the questions.
We used open-everything (notes, internet, etc.) quizzes 
roughly weekly to assess student knowledge and ability, 
including asking them to troubleshoot deliberately created 
problems. For example, after being introduced to R, the students 
were given a quiz that asked them to modify an existing script

like this can be an accessible way to begin to bring open-
ended research into an existing class, and the specific topic
should be of broad interest to students. Students who can
see connections between the science they are learning and
the real-world perform better and are more likely to persist
in science (Cromley et al., 2016), particularly if they can
see how the science may be personally relevant to their
lives, which may be especially important for underrepresented
minorities (Hurtado et al., 2010). By connecting hands-on
research with a question relevant to the everyday lives of
students and their communities (what people eat and how it
can affect them), this module aims to stoke studentsâÃÃ´ interest
and engagement with science, and contribute to a reduction in
achievement gaps.
How do we hope to achieve these goals? This module
brings authentic research to students as part of their
normal curriculum. Though there are various frameworks
for evaluating the authenticity of research experiences (reviewed
in Rowland et al., 2017), we have taken advantage of the
simplicity of the CUREnet five dimensions framework
(Auchincloss et al., 2014) and have mapped how this module
embodies each dimension in Table 1. We have only begun
to assess the impact of this module on students. However,

in the form of DNA and gets transcribed into functional RNAs 

(mRNA, tRNA, rRNA) and translated in protein

âÃÂ¢ 
Differentiate between the organellar and nuclear genomes within a 

eukaryotic organism (nuclear, mitochondrial, chloroplast)

âÃÂ¢ 
Understand what DNA components are part of a whole genome 

shotgun assembly (e.g., nuclear, mitochondrial, chloroplast 

genomes)

âÃÂ¢ 
Perform background research on the biological study system, 

including how to concisely introduce the system to a broad 

audience and summarize the current state of the literature. This 

includes knowing how to find and read relevant scientific literature 

and how to properly cite references

âÃÂ¢ 
Assemble the relevant background research and findings into 

a professional scientific presentation. Students can either write 

a short description of the work they performed, which could

the mitochondrial annotation is the main way to assess student 

engagement and performance during the course. Before 

students submit their fully annotated organellar genomes to 

NCBI, the instructor should manually check each annotation.

Exaiptasia-Algae System, or SEA System, which leverages the model anemone Exaiptasia diaphana (often used as a proxy for 

corals in research laboratories) along with its dinoflagellate symbionts. The SEA System represents a cost-effective, tractable 

platform for students to explore symbiosis and coral biology in the laboratory. We provide lesson plans for both a Preliminary 

Laboratory Activity (PLA) and multiple Authentic Research Experiences (AREs) that are accompanied by detailed, user-friendly 

protocols.""",Several class/lab periods,,,Yes,"""Importantly, CUREs provide opportunities for students 

to engage in authentic research during the academic year, 

unlike traditional summer research projects (e.g., Research 

Experiences for Undergraduates, or REUs). CUREs thereby 

remove a barrier to access that is difficult for some students, 

particularly those from underserved groups, to overcome. 

Like all CUREs, the SEAS CURE thus provides an excellent 

opportunity to include all students in authentic research 

experiences, at levels ranging from introductory to advanced 

(14).

The fate of corals in a warming world is a topic about which 

few students know much from their own experience or their 

prior academic work. However, once they begin learning about 

the ecosystem services of corals and the human dimensions of 

coral reef decline, almost all students find the issue compelling 

and urgent. Students quickly grasp that the complexity of this 

work demands skills and perspectives from a broad range of 

disciplines. They also recognize that the diversity required to 

solve large global challenges encompasses not only scientific 

disciplines but also identities such as gender, ethnicity, 

religion, socioeconomic status, personality, and approach 

to problem-solving (15). In each of the AREs described here, 

students engage in making connections across ecological, 

organismal, physiological and cellular scales to address 

impacts of climate change and other anthropogenic threats to 

the ecosystem services of corals.

To create and empower inclusive research teams, instructors 

must be intentional about demonstrating the value of diversity 

in teamwork and must make the practice of collaborative work 

(including effective communication, conflict management, 

and consensus building) a key learning objective for the 

course (16). A core competency in the Vision and Change n Undergraduate Biology Education report is the ""ability to 

communicate and collaborate with other disciplines."" Both 

faculty and students should be intentional and reflective 

about engaging in teamwork, first by making the collaborative 

process a valued component of each studentâÃÃ´s individual 

efforts and second by implementing teaching approaches 

that support students in developing inclusive and equitable 

collaboration skills. An excellent resource for instructors 

wishing to cultivate inclusivity and equity in teamwork is 

available at the 
. 

This resource offers suggestions for teaching approaches 

that support students as they form a team and work together 

through a project (e.g., how to structure teamwork in a way 

that ensures interdependence among the students, how to 

create accountability of each individual while working in a 

team). Valuing the collaborative process is key to cultivating 

inclusivity and equity because doing so allows students to see 

for themselves that complex problems require diverse skills, 

perspectives, and contributions.

When implementing CUREs, work should be scaffolded so 

that students can establish an initial base of knowledge and 

skills and then build upon that foundation as they engage 

in the research process. For this reason, we encourage 

instructors to start with the PLA that introduces students to the 

SEA System. While familiarizing students with background 

information about the SEA System, instructors can use the 

simple laboratory activities embedded within the PLA to 

help students develop and practice the skills they will need 

when they begin developing their own project ideas (e.g.,

culturing the symbiotic partners). Further, by beginning with 

a broad introduction to the SEA System, instructors scaffold 

subsequent work, allowing students to tackle problems that 

would otherwise be intractable. Scaffolding is vital to an 

inclusive classroom as it provides instructors with a method 

for adapting their teaching to the individual needs of students 

(17).""",,,Yes,,Yes,,"Learning Goals

Active student engagement with these documents can occur 

through various modalities. During the COVID-19 response of 

Spring 2020, our lab was moved to a fully asynchronous online 

course format, and we assigned all remote lab documents 

to be completed as independent weekly assignments. In the 

subsequent semester the lab course was synchronous online, and 

each document in the set was assigned for collaborative weekly 

group work in Zoom breakout rooms. To facilitate collaboration, 

documents were posted to Google docs as ""view only"" files, 

and each group created and shared their own set of editable 

copies to work on together. In both semesters, the assignment 

sets served as summative assessments of the lab course learning 

objectives in a form of a culminating project.

As an alternative to a culminating project, these documents 

could be used as instructional aids about the research process 

during the course. Instruction could occur in-person or remotely, 

and students could then complete the relevant document as a 

formative assessment and a way to reinforce the instruction. With this approach, instructors could use one data set to model 

and work through as a whole group; then students could select 

one of the other two datasets to work through independently.""",,Formative assessment; Worksheet,,"""Each assignment in this framework serves as a stepwise

students' ability to make sense of a large body of quantitative data, a situation they may rarely have encountered.

We treat statistics with a strictly conceptual, pragmatic, and abbreviated approach; i.e., we ask students to know which basic test to choose to assess a linear relationship vs. a difference between two means. We stress the need for a normal distribution in order to use these tests, and how to interpret the results; we leave the rest for stats courses, and we do not teach the mathematics. This approach proves beneficial even to those who have already had a statistics course, because it is often the first time they make decisions about applying statistics to their own research questions.

We incorporate peer review and collaborative work throughout the quarter. We form collaborative groups around the research questions they ask, enabling them to share primary literature they find, and preparing them well to review each other's writing.

Students keep online lab notebooks that the instructor reads and comments on each week; these notebooks are a place where students and the instructor track activities that they complete in and out of class. The instructor works with each student closely, meeting students in class and offering both written and video feedback through the learning management system.

Write papers that highlight a variety of aspects of the original dataset, providing insights that may influence future directions of study.

background and possibly other characteristics that may not be 
visible to the instructor.

The activity involves individual and group tasks. Small 
group tasks are considered cooperative learning techniques 
and have been described as active learning exercises that 
foster student 
learning 
(20). Furthermore, high 
impact 
active learning practices have been recognized to serve the 
improvement of attrition and retention of minority students 
(18). The major benefit is that students are actively engaged 
in their own learning and learn from each other, not just from 
their instructor.",No Hits,,No,,Yes,,"Learning Goal(s)
In a unique active learning experience, students will use a simple 
simulation to analyze the gut microbiome at multiple systematic 
levels (e.g. phylum, genus, species) and apply the newly gained 
knowledge in a context that is relevant to human health. They 
will identify metabolic pathways and products that contribute 
to the microbiome as a system and learn about the impact of 
microorganisms on their bodies. The learning objectives are in 
alignment with the Microbiology Learning Framework from the 
American Society for Microbiology (https://www.coursesource.org/
courses/microbiology). 
The mimicking of the antibiotic treatment is an example of ""Choose 
a perturbation to a novel environment, and predict the change to the 
resident microbial community"" under Systems. 
The determination of the bacterial metabolic byproducts that the 
bacteria excrete falls under ""How does the survival and growth of 
any microorganism in a given environment depend on its metabolic 
characteristics?"" under Metabolism. 
The investigation of the human host response to a certain diet 
covers ""Describe how the human biome influences the host human 
organism,"" also under Systems.
Learning Objective(s)
Students will be able to:
âÃÂ¢ Identify several of the nine phyla that contribute to the gut 
microbiome and name the two predominant ones.
âÃÂ¢ Describe how diet impacts the gut microbiome and compare the 
composition of the gut microbiome between different diets.
âÃÂ¢ Describe how antibiotic treatment impacts the gut microbiome and 
understand how this leads to infection, for example by Clostridium 
difficile.
âÃÂ¢ Trace the response to a change in diet, starting with i) changes 
in the composition of the microbiome, followed by ii) changes 
in the bacterial metabolic pathways and the respective excreted 
metabolic products, resulting in iii) a molecular response in the 
host intestinal cells, and eventually iv) resulting in human disease.
âÃÂ¢ Improve their ability to read scientific literature.
âÃÂ¢ Express themselves orally and in writing.
âÃÂ¢ Develop team working skill.",,"Active learning
This active 
learning exercise engages students through 
multiple activities, including an in class simulation. Students 
will individually prepare for the class by reading an assigned 
review article in a professional journal (15). During class 
time, students will work in small groups to discover how 
the different forms and shapes of pasta from the simulation 
exercise connect to the information that is provided in the 
review article. Individual students may find additional sources 
of information provided online. Students then compile their 
results. Since every group received a pasta bag simulating a 
different diet, each group reports on their respective diet and 
students learn about all diets through reciprocal teaching. The 
instructor uses this information to compile a total picture of the 
gut microbiome in the form of a Formative Assessment Table 
(Table 3). To deepen their understanding of the molecular 
changes in the host intestinal cells that are caused by the changes in the microbiome and underly the health impact of 
diet, the follow up assignment is a two pages essay that the 
students will write in the same groups during the three days 
that follow the class exercise

""The goal of 
this laboratory session was to expose students to the 
practice of preparing LTP experiments so they are better 
informed about the entire process of conducting this type of 
work



As a learning goal, students were 
challenged with formulating an appropriate statistical 
analysis approach.


At Wellesley 
College, all neuroscience majors spend at least three weeks 
in the classroom learning about the molecular mechanisms 
of learning and memory with an emphasis on LTP
. 
Given 
the strong conceptual background that students gain 
through their lecture-based coursework, it is easy for 
students to form the misconception that they have a full 
understanding of what it would be like to perform LTP 
experiments themselves
. 
Our goal is to provide a deeper 
learning experience through hands-on experimentation, and 
show them that there is much more to be learned than what 
can be put on paper
. ""


",,"Laboratory 1
In groups of up to three, students rotated through four
stations to learn the following techniques required to prepare 
for an LTP experiment: (1) making artificial cerebrospinal 
fluid (ACSF); (2) pulling and testing glass recording 
microelectrodes; (3) dissecting a mouse brain from the skull
and preparing hippocampal slices; (4) practicing electrode 
placement and monitoring gravity fed ACSF flow rate
. 
Each 
station was demonstrated by an instructor
. 
Additionally, 
students watched an excerpt of a JoVE video showing a 
magnified version of the hippocampal dissection (Mathis et 
al., 2011; beginning at 4:27 of the video)
. 
Students visited
these stations in any order.
ACSF Preparation
Students performed calculations and prepared a standard 
recording ACSF solution containing (in mM) 119 NaCl, 2.5

KCl, 1.0 NaH2PO4, 26.2 NaHCO3, and 11.0 C6H12O6 in 
ddH2O
. 
To prevent precipitation of solutes, the ACSF was 
bubbled with carbogen while 200 Â¬ÂµM MgCl2 and 200 Â¬ÂµM 
CaCl2 were slowly added
. 
Additionally, we demonstrated 
that a cloudy precipitate develops in ACSF when bubbled 
with 100% O2 instead of carbogen, elucidating the 
importance of proper O2 and CO2 concentrations.
Pulling Glass Electrodes
Glass capillaries were made using a Flaming/Brown 
micropipette puller to create recording electrodes with a 1-3 
MÅÂ© resistance
. 
Resistance was verified by connecting the 
tip of a 10cc syringe to the opening of the electrode using a 
small piece of tubing, immersing the electrode tip into 70% 
ethanol, and depressing the plunger until air bubbles first 
appear in the ethanol
. 
Electrodes with the proper resistance
should release bubbles when 1-3cc of air in syringe is
displaced.
Brain Removal and Hippocampal Slice Preparations 
Optimal tissue health is essential for LTP experiments; 
therefore, 
brain 
dissection and 
hippocampal slice 
preparation must be done as rapidly as possible
. 
However
,
to build this skill one needs to practice this technique without 
time restrictions
. 
In this lab, the students learned how to 
remove an unfixed mouse brain from its skull and dissect out 
the hippocampus in a slow, controlled manner
. 
Instead of 
working with a deeply anesthetized animal, student 
dissections were done after mice were euthanized with 
isoflurane
. 
Students decapitated the mouse immediately 
rostral to the first cervical vertebra
. 
The whole brain was
removed from the cranium and immersed in ice-cold ACSF
bubbled with carbogen
. 
The brain was then placed on an 
ice-cold platform with ACSF and blocked by removing the 
cerebellum and approximately one quarter of the rostral 
frontal lobes using a scalpel blade
. 
A cut was made at the 
interhemispheric fissure to separate the two hemispheres
. 
The hippocampus was carefully separated from the cerebral 
hemisphere as described by others (Mathis et al., 2011; 
Villers and Ris, 2013)
. 
Transverse hippocampal slices (400 
Â¬Âµm) were cut using a tissue chopper (Villers and Ris, 2013) 
and transferred to a slice keeper containing carbogenated 
recording ACSF maintained at 37o C in a water bath
.
Monitoring Flow Rate and Placing Electrodes
Using an I.V
. 
flow regulator, students practiced maintaining
a 2
-
3 mL/min flow rate of ACSF recording solution through 
the recording chamber
. 
With a plastic transfer pipette, a
single hippocampal slice was carefully removed from the
slice keeper and placed on a nylon netting stage positioned 
in the center of the recording chamber (Figure 1)
. 
Students 
practiced using the micromanipulator to position a bipolar 
stimulating electrode on the Schaffer collateral axons
. 
They 
then practiced placing the glass recording micropipette 
backfilled with ACSF about 1-2 mm downstream from the 
stimulating electrode in the apical dendrite region of area 
CA1 (Figure 2).
Laboratory 2
Instructors prepared for Laboratory 2 using the same 
techniques the students learned during Laboratory 1 with 
slight modifications.
Instructor Prepared ACSF
Instructors prepared fresh recording ACSF
, 
as previously 
described, and a cutting ACSF using the same recipe 
lacking CaCl2 for the hippocampal slice preparation steps.
Instructor Prepared Hippocampal Slices 
Mice were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane in a bell jar in 
a chemical fume hood prior to sacrifice by decapitation
. 
After decapitation, the brains were dissected rapidly from 
the skull and placed in ice-cold (~5ÃÃ¶C), carbogen-bubbled 
cutting ACSF for one minute
. 
Transverse hippocampal 
slices were prepared as previously described
. 
To obtain the 
healthiest hippocampal slices, the brain was removed from 
the cranium within one minute of sacrifice, and hippocampal 
slices were prepared within 8-12 minutes of brain removal
. 
Hippocampal slice preparation was accomplished with the 
assistance of another individual to maximize speed and 
efficiency
. 
Slices were incubated in the slice keeper for at 
least 30 minutes at 37o C before extracellular recordings 
were performed
. 
Alternatively, one can incubate slices for 2 
hours at room temperature with similar results.
Extracellular Electrophysiological Recordings
As practiced in Laboratory 1, students first adjusted the flow 
rate of gravity-fed warm carbogen-bubbled ACSF through 
the recording chamber to 2-3 mL/min and then carefully 
transferred a single instructor-prepared hippocampal slice 
from the slice keeper to the nylon netting of the recording 
chamber using a plastic transfer pipette
. 
Next, the students 
confirmed the resistance of the recording electrode using 
the ohmmeter function on the DC amplifier
. 
The stimulating 
electrode was placed just touching the surface of the 
hippocampal slice on the Shaffer collateral fiber tract in the 
stratum radiatum (Figure 2A)
. 
The recording electrode was 
lowered to the surface of the tissue downstream of the 
recording electrode in the dendritic layer of the CA1 
pyramidal cells (Figure 2B)
. 
The recording electrode was 
then incrementally lowered ~10 Â¬Âµm at a time followed by the 
delivery of a single stimulus pulse (0.1 or 0.2 ms, 500 Â¬ÂµA) 
until a postsynaptic field potential response was detected
. 
If 
students did not detect field potentials after some 
troubleshooting, they were encouraged to retrieve another 
slice and try again
. 
A useful resource to help students 
identify electrical traces associated with appropriate 
electrode placement and ideal field potential recordings is 
Paul et al., 1997 (p
. 
192).
 
Single stimulus pulses (0.2 ms, 500 Â¬ÂµA) were delivered 
through the stimulating electrode by an isolated pulse 
stimulator to orthodromically stimulate 
Schaffer 
collateral/commissural fibers
. 
Postsynaptic field potential 
responses were recorded in area CA1 with the glass 
micropipette
. 
Signals were amplified by 10X
. 
The Powerlab 
digitizer was used for data acquisition and the recordings 
were stored on a computer for subsequent analysis with 
LabChart 7 software
. 
An inputâÃÃ¬output (I-O) voltage curve 
was obtained by recording responses at 25 Â¬ÂµA increments, 
starting approximately at threshold (325 Â¬ÂµA) and ending at
saturation (700 Â¬ÂµA)
. 
Saturation was reached when two 
sequential stimulus intensities no longer produced increases 
in field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSPs) slopes
. 
Stimulus strength was adjusted for the remainder of the 
experiment to evoke potentials with a slope approximately 
50% of the maximum response obtained in the I-O curve 
(~250 Â¬ÂµA)
. 
Twenty baseline test stimuli were delivered and 
recorded at 8 second intervals prior to tetanic stimulation
. 
Potentiation was induced by administering four trains of high 
frequency (100 Hz) pulses with a 1-minute intertrain interval
. 
Stimulus response was recorded 10 and 30 minutes 
following tetanic stimulation
. 
Data Analysis 
The initial slope of the fEPSP was used as a measure of 
synaptic strength
. 
We employed the common practice of 
determining synaptic strength by measuring the initial slope 
of the fEPSP rather than the potential amplitude to avoid 
contamination of the fEPSP by a population spike (Taube 
and Schwartzkroin, 1988; Sarvey et al., 1989)
. 
The 
maximum negative slope of each recording from one 
hippocampal slice was determined by calculating the 
derivative of the curve using LabChart 7
. 
The percent 
change in initial slope of fEPSP 10 and 30 minutes post-
tetanic stimulation compared to average baseline was
calculated
. 
Statistical significance comparing the percent 
change in initial slope of fEPSP 10 and 30 minutes post-
tetanic stimulation compared to average baseline was 
calculated using a one-way repeated measures ANOVA at 
95% confidence

The laboratory comprises multi-week modules that expand upon the topics being covered in class. In the class for which this module was developed, a key topic under discussion is the role played by the nervous system in aging and/or lifespan. This laboratory module focuses on the model organism, Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans), which has been studied extensively. There is a large and ongoing literature elucidating a number of genes involved in determining or modulating lifespan in C. elegans. Students choose a candidate gerontogene expressed in neurons in C. elegans from a provided list for which we have mutant strains. Students use available databases to become experts on their candidate gene and design, carry out and analyze a behavioral experiment. In addition, students use available bioinformatics and genomic tools to conduct a protein sequence phylogenetic analysis of their candidate protein across at least 10 different taxa of animals.

with the use of major databases, particularly NCBI, 

WormBase and others. 
We also expect them to gain 

substantial knowledge about their chosen gene, as well as 

experience in designing experiments and using appropriate

statistics. We assessed this knowledge by having problem 

set style assignments. For example, students submitted 

experimental designs and then had faculty/student 

conferences to go over the designs and discuss other 

details important for planning and conducting a good 

experiment (issues like appropriate controls, sample size, 

types of statistical analysis, etc). 
Another assignment 

included a sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree 

construction using bacterial 16S rRNA sequence data from 

a database provided by the Joint Genome Institute 16S 

rRNA phylogenic homework assignment. 
Another 

assessment of student knowledge and mastery was the 

student presentation.

 
In addition to these more traditional forms of 

assessment, we also administered a skills questionnaire 

(Table 2) before the beginning of the laboratory module 

and again a few weeks after the conclusion of the 

laboratory module. This questionnaire allows students to 

report their confidence level in using bioinformatics and 

comparative genomics software tools and approaches. Figure 3 demonstrates that student confidence in these 

skills was substantially improved after the laboratory 

module. We found a substantial increase in student-

reported confidence employing the skills we emphasized 

(Fig. 3). Fewer than 10% of the 23 students we surveyed 

reported confidence identifying analogous genes using 

Blast or constructing phylogenetic or protein sequence 

similarity trees before the lab module. By the end of the 

module, 80% or more students felt confident with these 

skills. We noticed in our own observations in lab and in 

evaluating the quality of the student data analysis a 

substantial improvement in student ability to describe and 

interpret these kinds of data. This, combined with the 

student performance on the other graded assignments, 

indicates to us that the laboratory module successfully 

enhanced student learning of these techniques and 

approaches.

 
Finally, we administered a Likert-based attitude 

questionnaire (Likert, 1932) at the end of the laboratory 

module to gauge student attitudes about the use of 

bioinformatics and comparative genomics approaches in 

neuroscience and behavior (Table 3, Figure 4). We asked 

students to rate the degree to which they agreed or 

disagreed with seven statements, with 5 indicating strong 

agreement and 1 indicating strong disagreement. The 

statements focused on the use of bioinformatics and 

comparative genomics approaches in neuroscience and 

behavior since these are new approaches that many 

students do not tend to associate with the field. Indeed, our 

initial observations of students at the beginning of the 

module suggested to us that a majority of the class was 

skeptical at first about the relevance of these approaches 

to their study of neuroscience. However, more than 80% 

of the students, surveyed after the laboratory module, 

agreed or strongly agreed that ""genomics approaches are 

important for current neuroscience and behavior research"" 

and 65% felt that the approach enhanced their overall 

understanding of the complex topic of aging and 

gerontogenes (Fig. 4). 
In response to a final question, 

75% of the students surveyed would take another course 

that used these approaches to neuroscience and behavior, 

indicating the effectiveness of the module in achieving 

those particular course goals.

Student achievement of the established learning objec-
tives are evaluated mostly through a semester-long process
of writing and revision, in which students progressively con-
struct a report modeled after a research article (Table 2).
This gradual crafting of a report mirrors the developing
engagement of the students in the research project: as stu-
dents become familiar with the research literature, they
write an Introduction; upon performing experiments, they
write Materials and Methods; as they gather and interpret
data, they write a Results section; and as they interpret and
contextualize the results, they write the Discussion. Upon
completion of each stage of the project and writing the cor-
responding section of the report, students receive input and
recommendations from instructors on each section
(Writing Deliverables in Tables 1 and 2). A grading rubric
used in other laboratory courses in our school is used as a
formative assessment and evaluation tool (see Appendix 11
and Appendix 12 for examples of student data).
In addition to being used as a means for student evalua-
tion (Table 3), writing assignments and deliverables fulfill the
critical objective of improving studentsâÃÃ´ ability to effectively
communicate the results of research to peers, the scientific
community, and the public. A second way of assessing student
learning is through final oral presentations that are presented
to instructors, peers and other researchers on campus.
During one of the semesters that the course was offered, a
local coral reef symposium was held near our campus. All stu-
dents enrolled in the course attended the symposium and also
submitted an abstract, which was required for evaluation as a
writing deliverable during that semester. A group of three stu-
dents gave an oral presentation to describe the project to all
symposium participants (Appendix 13). To ensure that stu-
dents were supported in the development of their scientific
presentation skills and were prepared for the presentation, we
provided opportunities to practice in class and offered extended comments on presentations (Appendix 14). Other
coral reef researchers and members of conservation groups
were in attendance for this presentation. Although this was a
unique scenario, it clearly evidenced that students fulfilled the
learning objective of effectively communicating the results of
research to peers and members of the scientific community.","LO's are aligned to assessments (Exemplar)

realm of David KolbâÃÃ´s learning styles, as laid out in his 1984 

treatise on experiential learning (5). Such students fall closer to 

the ""active experimentation"" end on the processing dimension 

and the ""abstract conceptualization"" end on the perception 

dimension (5), giving them some of the qualities associated 

with engineers, whose work involves iterative modes of thinking conceptually and then instantiating and executing 

ideas in the real world to see if their ideas work in practice. 

Those students who do have the opportunity actually to handle 

the Silly PuttyÂ¬Ã material may be able to approach the lesson 

from the learning perspectives of either a ""Pragmatist""âÃÃ®

putting abstract concepts into real-world practiceâÃÃ®and/or a 

""Reflector""âÃÃ®observing and then subsequently thinking about 

activities (6). 

Though the students themselves, in a large lecture classroom, 

cannot all have the concrete tactile experience of directly 

handling the Silly PuttyÂ¬Ã, they are all in fact able to watch 

it being handled. Such observation can engage the mirror 

neuron system, which is thought to be essential for learning by 

imitation (for a review of this system, see Reference 7). Thus, 

the demonstration has the potential for also possibly tapping 

into other sensory modalities (e.g., touch), or cortically-

mirrored motor planning to enrich the student experience of 

the lesson. 

While the practice of specifically modifying teaching 

methodologies to match preferred student learning styles 

has come under recent scrutiny and skepticism (8, 9), 

engaging students of different academic backgrounds and 

life experiences remains nevertheless as important as it is 

challenging, particularly when discussing dense material such 

as this. Therefore, framing the lesson within the context of 

athletics, and using familiar objects, can render the lesson less 

intimidating and make the content more universally accessible. 

We designed this activity so it may facilitate meaningful 

connections for the students, perhaps even including personal 

ones. Building such connections may result in improvements 

to the affective domain (10) of studentsâÃÃ´ relationships to and 

perceptions or understanding of the coursework. Reciprocally, 

improvements in the affective domain have the potential to 

positively impact studentsâÃÃ´ attitudes towards and personal 

attachment to STEM material. Being able to draw links 

between the course material and everyday-life applications 

helps studentsâÃÃ®especially from underrepresented minority 

groupsâÃÃ®develop a greater sense of belonging in STEM fields 

(11), and thus enhances their experience in the classroom and 

the course, which may additionally have the beneficial effect 

of aiding in student retention.""",,,No,,Yes,,"Learning Goal(s)

Students will understand:

âÃÂ¢ 
the principles of bone biomechanics.

âÃÂ¢ 
how the structure of bones complements their functions.

Learning Objective(s)

Students will be able to:

âÃÂ¢ 
explain how the anatomical structure of long bones relates to their 

function.

âÃÂ¢ 
define viscoelasticity, hysteresis, anisotropy, stiffness, strength, 

ductility, and toughness. 

âÃÂ¢ 
identify the elastic and plastic regions of a stress-strain curve. They 

will be able to correlate each phase of the stress-strain curve with 

physical changes to bone. 

âÃÂ¢ 
predict how a bone would respond to changes in the magnitude of 

an applied force, and to variations in the speed or angle at which a 

force is applied.

âÃÂ¢ 
determine the reason(s) why bone injuries occur more frequently 

during athletic events than during normal everyday use.",,"""Engaging students in active learning in a large lecture 

classroom presents many challenges, not least of which is the 

sheer number of students present. With an attention-grabbing 

demonstration such as thisâÃÃ®with balls of Silly PuttyÂ¬Ã being 

actively stretched, crushed, thrown, and bounced around the 

lecture hall, there is a palpable uptick in interest and engagement 

in the classroom. Bone mechanics, like most engineering 

concepts, is often explained using dense vocabulary which is 

likely to be unfamiliar to most students. As such, students often 

struggle to find ways to incorporate the information delivered 

via lecturing. For this lesson, having the students complete the 

pre-class primer and/or worksheet (Supporting Material S1. 

Bone Viscoelasticity: Bone Biomechanics Primer, Supporting 

Material S2. Bone Viscoelasticity: Worksheet) places the responsibility for understanding the terminology that will be 

used during the demonstration on the students themselves. 

Depending on the resources available to the instructor, the 

beginning of class would be an ideal place to incorporate a 

formative assessment of the studentsâÃÃ´ retention of these self-

taught concepts using a classroom response system (e.g. 

clickers or polling software). For example, instructors could 

ask students to classify a list of everyday materials as being 

stiff (carpentry nails, golf balls, tin cups) or flexible (fingernails, 

kickballs, paper cups); or to rank a series of common materials 

(such as plastic bottles, aluminum foil, and polyethylene bags) 

in order of decreasing strength.

During the lesson itself, the suggested think-pair-share 

questions asking students to make comparisons between 

different points on the stress-strain curves (or between different 

conditions), facilitate peer and instructor discussion, which are 

the generally-accepted hallmarks of an active classroom. (See, 

for reference, slides 11-13 of Supporting Material S3. Bone 

Viscoelasticity: Bone Biomechanics Lecture Slides.) Moreover, 

the one-minute essay wrap-up question, relating bone fracture 

patterns back to the biomechanical concepts described in the 

lesson, create an opportunity for reflection and further in-class 

discussion. (For reference, see slide 15 of Supporting Material 

S3. Bone Viscoelasticity: Bone Biomechanics Lecture Slides.) 

Depending on the size and setup of the classroom, and if 

time permits, the interpretation of fracture patterns could also 

be easily adapted into a jigsaw activity to further increase 

engagement and discussion within the classroom. For 

example, small groups of students could be assigned a specific 

fracture pattern to research, identify, and explain. Upon each 

groupâÃÃ´s reaching of a consensus, students from a given group 

join another group, and exchange ideas and explain their 

answer and rationale. This process continues until the class 

has reached a consensus on all fracture patterns.""",,Formative assessment; Quiz; Worksheet,,"""Learning is measured both in real time with student responses

For example, instructors are often left to decide what type of active learning activities to incorporate and how to implement them yet receive little to no formal training about how to do this effectively. Additionally, student resistance to active learning persists, which adds to the pressure faced by some instructors. Compounding these issues is the absence of high-speed Internet in some regions, which makes accessing active learning activities, many of which are offered through online commercial programs, impractical if not impossible for some students.

mance and perceptions of their understanding of DNA directional-
ity, the steps of PCR, and bioinformatics tools such as BLAST.
Student knowledge was assessed on the pre- and postsurveys by
asking the students to write the reverse complement of a DNA
sequence and indicate directionality. The retention assessment (5

primers with proper directionality when given a DNA sequence.

Here, hominid refers to the family Hominidea; that is, all modern and extinct Great Apes--including humans, chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans. Rather than as a step-by-step fixed protocol, this laboratory is presented with options that emphasize adaptability to various pedagogical approaches and instructional levels. Versions of this laboratory have been used in college evolution and introductory biology courses; adaptations are likely to be of value for other courses, including non-majors' biology, comparative anatomy, and secondary school biology. Features of skulls (commercially obtained skull casts) are identified and compared by students in order to develop an evolutionary analysis centered on functional anatomy. The focus of this exercise is on structural features that relate to three characteristics central in human evolutionary history: brain size, posture, and mastication. As with other published activities designed to explore hominid evolution using skull comparisons (Nickels, 1999; Nickels, 1987), various quantitative and qualitative measures are introduced and employed. However, this exercise also extends this approach in a novel way by employing quantitative craniometric relationships made using digital imaging.

As for 
any other knowledge, students must create their own deep understanding of the Central Dogma. Students may not develop 
this understanding because they have limited opportunity to practice manipulating DNA sequences and classifying their 
effects. Such practice can improve student appreciation for the myriad possible effects of DNA change (mutation) on 
amino acid sequence. In this Lesson, a series of scaffolded exercises provides this opportunity. Students first identify gene 
sequences from an online database, create their own insertion/deletion mutations, and predict the effects. Students then 
use a web-based tool to translate and observe the effect of the mutation on protein sequence. Subsequent comparison of 
predicted and observed effects employs the chi-square test. Discussion of results with peers involves categorizing the types 
of possible effects. The lesson concludes with an exercise asking students to create a mutation with an intended effect 
on the protein. Together, the exercises integrate quantitative reasoning and statistical analysis, information literacy, and 
multiple BloomâÃÃ´s learning levels. Student progress is monitored using three formative and three summative assessments",Several class/lab periods,,,Yes,"he Lesson addresses diversity in at least five ways. First, 
by engaging students in think-pair-share and group discussion 
as well as by using volunteer-response questions, the Lesson 
accommodates both introverts and extroverts. Having both 
student-selected groups as well as groups formed randomly 
also lets all the students access the varying expertise of peers 
that they might not normally choose to interact with. Third, 
the topic of the Lesson itself, how mutation affects protein 
sequence, is inextricably coupled with appreciation for the 
basis of diversity: DNA sequence changes leading to protein 
sequence changes via the central dogma. The Lesson also 
promotes diversity by allowing students to select a gene 
sequence of their own choosing for analysis, rather than every 
student working on the same gene selected by the instructor. 
Such an approach allows the Lesson to show case genetic 
diversity and to allow the students to draw broad conclusions 
about similarities and differences resulting from related types 
of mutations. Finally, the example used in the first class to 
motivate the Lesson, the genetic basis of human earwax type, 
provokes questions about the genetic differences between 
human populations and potential forces promoting those 
differences",,,Yes,,Yes,,"Learning Goal(s)

parasitology involve human health and well-being and provide 
a wealth of opportunities to model respectful and inclusive 
ways of discussing the diverse lives and experiences of humans 
around the world. For example, lecture material in the ecology 
and evolution unit of this course included discussions of human 
diseases (e.g., hookworm, malaria) and ecological issues (e.g., 
amphibian loss to chytrid fungus) that disproportionately affect 
people living in tropical regions and the Global South (19). In 
discussing these topics, we were careful to counteract harmful 
and pervasive stereotypes that associate parasite risk with the 
behaviors and cultural markers of certain groups of people, 
and not to invoke colonialist assumptions about the economic 
development and public health infrastructure of regions affected 
by these ecological problems and diseases (20). Wherever 
possible, we also focused on research of scientists living in the 
regions most affected by the subject of their study.
Due to the inherent intertwining of human experiences with 
health- and environment-related topics in parasitology, there 
are ample opportunities in this kind of course for engaging 
students with activities that will allow them to reflect critically 
on the intersections of social equity, public health, and their 
own assumptions through a socio-scientific issues framework 
(21, 22). For example, the link between hookworm infection, 
anemia, and impaired cognitive development is often illustrated 
in parasitology textbooks through the story of Charles StilesâÃÃ´ 1902 
announcement of the discovery of the ""germ of laziness"" in the 
American Southeast and subsequent public health initiatives 
funded by John D. Rockefeller (e.g., 2, page 360). While 
this narrative conveys real historical events and biology, the 
commonly used structure of the story tacitly reinforces harmful 
stereotypes about the populations that were affected. It also 
ignores important historical context where public messaging 
around this biological discovery was used to support and spread 
racist and classist ideologies in public health and popular culture 
(23). Teaching such material can be made more inclusive by 
integrating an explicit discussion of the social context in which 
the scientific discoveries were made, and the role scientific 
information and subsequent interpretation play in constructing 
both public policy and public narratives (see 21, 22).",,,No,,Yes,,"Learning Goals

designed to ensure that students understood (1) the study 
system, (2) the goals of the study, (3) the methods used, (4) 
the evidence provided by the results, and (5) the biological 
conclusions drawn by the author. Completing this assignment 
required a range of skills including finding information in the 
text, reading comprehension, graph literacy, and synthesizing 
information well enough to make predictions about the outcome 
of a hypothetical scenario. Student responses were graded on 
completion and factual correctness (Answer key provided as 
Supporting File S3. Parasite Ecology âÃÃ¬ Part I: Primary Literature

organized the discussion on an asynchronous, virtual message 
board in Canvas. We used a ""muddiest point"" approach (17, 
18) to stimulate discussion by asking students to identify a 
specific method, result, or conclusion in the paper that confused 
them. Students earned points for posting initial questions and 
responding to their peerâÃÃ´s posts. Instructors assigned points for 
completion, but also screened posts to ensure relevance and 
adherence to course conduct guidelines (e.g., ensuring no 
harassing behavior was displayed online).
Part II included four guided tasks to produce graphs followed 
by six short answer questions that varied in the degree of creative 
thinking required to answer. The primary skills assessed through 
this assignment are graph literacy, mathematical reasoning, and 
the interpretation of biological meaning from data. Graph-based 
responses were graded using a rubric that assigned points for 
giving the correct answer and for constructing a figure with all 
of the requested elements (a model of the required elements for 
each graph is included in the assignment handout, Supporting

rare. For the final question, students were asked to extend their 
understanding of the topic by proposing two additional factors

The purpose of the lab is to: determine if plants with particular attributes differ in susceptibility to attack by herbivores, and if herbivores act as parasites, commensals, or possibly mutualists when they feed on plants by having a negative, neutral, or positive effect on plant reproduction. First, students measure plant traits to test two competing hypotheses to explain variation in abundance of herbivorous insects among plants. The Plant Stress Hypothesis and the Plant Vigor Hypothesis both argue that plant physiological status and growth will impact the success of herbivores, but one proposes that stressed plants will be vulnerable to attack because they provide better food with higher amino acid content for herbivores, while the other proposes that vigorously growing plants will provide better food. Second, students measure plant reproductive traits to test competing hypotheses about the effect of herbivores on plant reproduction. These hypotheses are the Negative Impact, the Plant Tolerance, and the Overcompensation hypotheses; the hypotheses suggest, respectively, that plants attacked by herbivores will produce a number and quality of seeds that is less than, similar to, or greater than the number and quality produced by plants not attacked by herbivores.

",,"Regardless of delivery format, this case study actively 
engages student learning by prompting students to explore 
outside resources, involving real-world situations, and 
providing scaffolded questions. Engaging visual content or 
interaction with realistic data promotes deeper understanding 
of material and appeals to a variety of learning preferences 
(27). Students work in groups to complete the case, which 
provides social stimulation and helps students solve problems 
that might otherwise be too difficult for any one student to solve 
alone. This collaboration across disciplines is an important 
skill and highlights the multidisciplinary nature of science and 
medicine (17). If taught in a synchronous classroom setting, 
case questions provide many opportunities for students to 
express their opinions and explain their answers to the class.",,Formative assessment; Data (hand in a dataset and/or figure); Other,case analysis and artifacts generated.,"The Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) publishes 
guidelines on the engagement of students in modeling 
science curriculum (28). Pedagogical approaches focused 
on engagement of students by answering realistic questions, 
using guided instructions to analyze and synthesize data and 
generate models has been particularly effective in teaching 
skills to emerging scientists (29,30). When students connect 
ideas during multiple levels of analysis and link concepts 
to specific ideas, these learning exercises are effective at 
promoting student learning (31). Several intrinsic assessment 
mechanisms are embedded within the case modules to provide 
instructor opportunities for formative learning assessments. 
Instructors evaluate achievement of learning objectives by 
evaluating the case analysis (correct/incorrect answers to 
case questions and strength of argument for open-ended 
questions). Instructors also have the opportunity to assess 
student generated spreadsheets, charts, graphs, and sketches 
throughout the case for both completion and accuracy. In doing 
so, the instructor measures knowledge and understanding, 
critical-thinking skills, problem-solving skills, and (for student 
groups) collaborative learning skills. Quantitative scoring of 
the case may vary for different courses, leaving the instructor 
latitude to adapt the case for their student population and 
course structure. The use of de-identified student quotes was 
covered by: NCSU IRB protocol #11758.

reading material are included in the lessons. In lecture, students 
are first introduced to the use of G. mellonella and in vivo
antimicrobial studies. Application-style questions are included 
for students to test their understanding of the concepts discussed. 
Application-style questions are asked to the entire class as well 
as in smaller groups (breakout sessions). The questions are used 
to gauge studentsâÃÃ´ perceptions on antimicrobial activity, the 
testing of antimicrobials in the experimental setting, as well 
as their understanding of how animal model data provides 
context for a therapeutic. Prior to the discussion of invertebrates 
in antimicrobial testing and the assignment of the case study, 
students are asked to read a manuscript where this model 
has been used. In class, students practice the analysis and 
interpretation of G. mellonella survival plots by using Kaplan-
Meier plots from published work. Students interpret and analyze 
Kaplan-Meier plots as an exercise in problem based-learning (16). 
For the entirety of the case study students work in collaborative 
groups of two in the analysis of the provided data. As they work 
on their case study, they can discuss their ideas with each other, 
their classmates and the instructor, who can consistently provide 
feedback through virtual or in-person meetings",,Formative assessment; Paper / report / problem set; Presentation; Data (hand in a dataset and/or figure); Summative Assessment; Other,"Lecture questions, analyzing a Kaplan-Meier plot","Lectures include application-style questions that allow

18). For example, instructors may want to choose Figures 1 
and 2 from the self-published report (15). Then, the groups 
reshuffle to include one member of each expert group. Each 
student in the reshuffled group can then share their expertise 
with the others. The lesson concludes with a whole class 
discussion that affirms what students have solved on their own 
and helps them through more troublesome areas.",,Formative assessment; Worksheet; Summative Assessment,,"Table 1 presents the way the lesson aligns to the learning 
goals and objectives.
To prepare for class, students submit a summary of the pre-
class reading that outlines ten criteria for evaluating material 
that is presented as science (13). The students summarize the 
reading and then describe in more detail three of the criteria 
that they find particularly helpful to apply (Supporting File S1:

(through the learning management system) at least one day 
before class starts, we evaluate their answers to the questions 
in Supporting File S1: Pre-class work and decide which points 
need additional clarification during class.
In class, we assess learning by eliciting student feedback 
during group discussions and by circulating through the 
classroom to see what students were writing down on the 
worksheets we provided to guide in-class activities (Supporting 
File S2: In Class Worksheet). We use these worksheets for 
formative assessment.
For summative assessment, we collect the worksheets at 
the end of class, spot-checking each to make sure that each 
student has met the learning objectives. We assign a grade for 
participation based on the quality of the completed worksheets,

",,Yes,,Yes,,"General Microbiology Course Learning Outcomes
The General Microbiology Course Learning Outcomes were
designed to integrate previous learning and develop advanced
scientific skills such as research and critical thinking. The
following course learning outcomes related to this activity are:
(1) Recognize microbiological concepts and terms used in
the primary scientific literature and to communicate with
other microbiologists and scientists.
(2) Discern the molecular, metabolic, structural, and ecological
differences between microbial cells and be able to explain
how these differences allow microbes to (a) live in almost
any environment on earth, (b) sense, react, and interact
with their environment as well as with other organisms,
and (c) serve as tools for science, medicine, and industry.
(3) Synthesize knowledge gained in previous courses and apply
it to novel microbiological questions.
Carbon Acquisition Lesson Learning Outcomes
This lesson has the following learning outcomes:
(1) Given the biotic and abiotic sources of carbon and
carbon-containing compounds, illustrate the biological
flow of carbon, starting from an initial, complex
carbon-containing molecule to a final product (CO2
or fermentation product).
(2) Illustrate the enzymatic reactions that hydrolyze
carbohydrates, nucleic acids, lipids, and proteins, and
identify the various exoenzymes involved in this process.
(3) Identify how different microbes secrete important proteins.
For this lesson, we focused on the first two outcomes by
asking students to work with a complex carbon-containing
product: paper. ",," For this particular 75-min
flipped lesson, students prepare by watching online videos about
the carbon cycle, protein secretion systems, exoenzymes, and
converting enzymes (for slides of this lecture, see Supplementary
Material 1.1). They are also encouraged to listen to a
podcast titled ""How much of our stuff actually gets recycled?""
(Brand, 2018).
A detailed summary of the lessonâÃÃ´s timeframe can be found
in Supplementary Table 1. For the engage phase of the 5E model,
students spend the first 8 min of class taking a readiness assurance
quiz (Supplementary Material 2). The quiz is followed by a short
discussion of the lessonâÃÃ´s learning outcomes (2 min) and a 5-
min in-class lecture where students are introduced to current
recycling challenges resulting from the adoption of National
Sword, a 2018 recycling policy instituted by China, as well as
a similar policy by India (Staub, 2020), that banned the import
of most recycled materials and set strict contamination limits
on recyclables (Allan, 2018)

To maintain their engagement
and bring home the effects of this policy, the class is asked
""What type of paper products would be rejected under ChinaâÃÃ´s
National Sword policy?"" After a 5-min discussion, students reply
that most paper products contaminated with food, such as pizza
boxes, soiled newspaper and paper towels would be rejected.
They further conclude that these paper products would end
up in a landfill (for slides used during this flipped lesson, see
Supplementary Material 1.2).
This introduction is followed by a short 5-min lecture on
how cardboard and paper products originate from the processing
of plants and trees. A figure from Bayer et al. (2007) is
used to illustrate the fate of plant material processed by the
paper industry, which generates paper products for human
consumption. Once used, these products end up in municipal
solid waste facilities where some are recycled, composted, or
incinerated. The large majority end up in landfills becoming
environmental pollution (Bayer et al., 2007).
Before they reflect on the material, students spend a few
minutes answering a metacognitive survey question ""Before
today, to what extent did you understand the role played by
microbes in the biodegradation of paper waste products?"" via
clickers (Supplementary Material 1.2). Following this, students
are asked to predict what happens to paper in a landfill, selecting
one of the following options in a clicker question: ""It remains
in the landfill, as paper is not degradable,"" ""It will decompose
by microbial activity involving respiration,"" ""It will decompose
by microbial activity involving fermentation,"" and ""Something
else will happen."" Together, these questions provide a baseline
assessment of the studentsâÃÃ´ understanding of the role played by
microorganisms in the biodegradation of paper waste products
(Figure 1C and Supplementary Figure 2A).
For the explore phase, students spend 10 min researching
and reflecting on different aspects of the molecular composition
of paper, the microbial communities that degrade paper, the
process of exoenzyme secretion, cellulose hydrolysis, and glucose
transport and discuss their findings with their table mates. Each
student group is divided into 2 subgroups, and each subgroup is
tasked with providing the answer to 3 questions (Supplementary
Material 1.2). One subgroup researches the answers to the
following questions: ""What is the molecular composition of
cardboard and paper?"", ""Which microorganisms would degrade
cardboard and paper?"", ""Are these biochemical processes happening
aerobically or anaerobically?"", and ""Which exoenzymes would these
organisms use?"". The second subgroup researches the questions:
""How would these exoenzymes be secreted?"", ""How would the
products of the exoenzymatic reactions be transported into the
cytoplasm of the bacteria?"", and ""Once in the cytoplasm, what
biochemical processes would be used in catabolic reactions?"".
For the explain phase, the instructors help students synthesize
their new knowledge and clarify misconceptions during a 10-min
class discussion where students from different tables discuss the
answers to these questions as a whole class.
In the second part of the activity, the elaborate phase, students
spend 15 min applying their knowledge by drawing the entire

While there are many popular activities to teach students the stages of mitosis, most make use of simple schematics, cartoons, or textbook diagrams. Others engage students in acting out the stages, or modeling them with physical objects (i.e. noodles, pipe cleaners). These approaches are useful for developing student knowledge and comprehension of the stages of cell division, but do not readily convey the real-life processes of mitosis. Moreover, they do not teach students how cell biologists study these processes, nor the difficulties with imaging real cells. Here, we provide an activity to reinforce student knowledge of mitosis, demonstrate how data on mitosis and other dynamic cellular processes can be collected, and introduce methods of data analysis for real cellular images using research-quality digital images from a free public database. This activity guides students through a virtual experiment that can be easily scaled for large introductory classes or low-resource settings. The activity focuses on experimentally determining the timing of the stages of cell division, directing the attention of students to the tasks that are completed at each stage and promoting understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Before the experiment, the students generate testable predictions for the relative amount of time each step of mitosis takes, provide a mechanistic reason for their prediction, and explain how they will test their predictions using imaging data. Students then identify the stages of cell division in a curated set of digital images and determine how to convert their data into relative amount of time for each phase of mitosis. Finally, students are asked to relate their findings to their original predictions, reinforcing their increasing understanding of the cell cycle.

stream was designed to help students understand that (1)
organismal diversity represents the result of an evolutionary
process, (2) many shared characters among organisms (e.g.,
developmental, morphological) are present because groups
of organisms are related to each other (i.e., they share a
common ancestor), and (3) phylogenies represent hypoth-
eses of evolutionary relationships. We addressed these
objectives by instituting curricular changes to teach our
students about organisms, not in a vacuum, but in a rich
phylogenetic and evolutionary context

Learning Goals
We had two overarching goals for the comparative biology
stream:
1. Introduce students to the natural history of animal
groups by describing their basic features and naming
a representative of each of the following nine animal
phyla (and to be aware that there are other phyla):
Porifera, Cnidaria, Platyhelminthes, Nematoda, Anne-
lida, Mollusca, Arthropoda, Echinodermata, and
Chordata.
2. Help budding biologists to understand evolution by
applying a phylogenetic (tree-thinking) approach that
uses phylogenetic trees as testable hypotheses of
evolutionary relationships within and between groups
of organisms.
In addition, we wanted to provide students with
opportunities to use technology (e.g., digital photomicro-
scopy, MS PowerPoint) and practice effective oral commu-
nication skills",,"Week one engages the students in an exploration of
different animals, how we might study their similarities
and differences in an organized way, and how these patterns
are a result of evolutionary relationships as depicted by
phylogenetic trees. These activities allow us to explore the
idea of phylogenies as hypotheses of evolutionary relation-
ship. During weeks two and three, student teams make a
series of observations, both at the gross scale and the micro
scale (using dissecting and compound microscopes, respec-
tively), of live and preserved animals representing nine
animal phyla that form the basis of their study. These
observations include the dissection of four representative
organisms. Teams record their observations in tabular form
and supplement their observations with information avail-
able from literature sources. During week four, we conclude
the stream with a team exercise that requires students to use
their tabulated observations to demonstrate an understand-
ing of phylogenies as hypotheses of relationship. In
addition, each student gives a short oral presentation
describing one aspect of his/her own animal explorations",,Presentation; Quiz; Data (hand in a dataset and/or figure); Other,pre/post test,,,Yes,"Cited as supplemental materials, supporting materials, or in an appendix","Detailed

Biology students require broad preparation for diverse careers including agriculture, natural resource management, 
and laboratory research. Concurrent with this need, employers are seeking applicants who have the scientific skills that 
allow them to solve problems related to locally relevant economic systems and develop ways to foster economic growth. 
To support these efforts, biology faculty from six different campuses in the University of Maine System collaborated

techniques (e.g., think-pair-share, clicker questions) because 
the active engagement of college students in STEM classes 
has been shown to increase student performance and decrease the failure rate when compared to classes where 
the predominant instructional mode is traditional lecturing 
(23). Additional work has revealed that active learning also 
decreases the achievement gap for first-generation and 
other underrepresented students (24). Overall, 41.6% of 
the full time students in the University of Maine System are 
first-generation students (https://staticweb.maine.edu/wp-
content/uploads/2016/02/First-Generation-Report-to-the-
Legislature-2015.pdf?565a1d); therefore, it was important to 
our group that we use instructional techniques that support 
their learning.
We also used examples that are economically relevant to 
the state of Maine throughout the lesson, and observed that 
students became more engaged when the discussion included 
an organism important to their community. For example, 
when students with experience in the timber industry were 
shown predicted changes in tree species community structure 
that correlated with an increase in global temperature, they 
commented on the potential economic disadvantages to their 
area. Students living in the potato farming region of the state 
commented on the specifics of how fertilizers are used and the 
effects these chemicals have on their community over time. 
Finally, at a campus near the coast, students connected the 
lesson to research on sugar kelp that was being conducted in 
their department.
Although the examples in this lesson focused on Maine 
industries, we encourage instructors to modify the lesson to 
connect it to economically relevant photosynthetic organisms 
in their own area. We used organisms that are grown in a 
variety of ways with both terrestrial (potato and timber) and 
aquatic (sugar kelp) examples to provide a variety of contexts 
in which students could apply photosynthetic concepts. To 
extend this work into other regions, instructors can consult 
data about local crop production (e.g. https://www.nass.
usda.gov/Charts_and_Maps/; https://ipad.fas.usda.gov/), 
guides focused on aquatic photosynthetic organisms (e.g. 
https://aquaplant.tamu.edu/plant-identification/; http://www.

activities including talking in discussion groups, answering 
and asking questions, discussing clicker questions, and filling 
out a worksheet (Supporting File S1: Presentation Slides With 
Instructor Notes; Supporting File S2: Student Worksheet). 
To document the types of instructional practices used, we 
analyzed instruction in nine of the 11 classrooms using the 
Classroom Observation Protocol for Undergraduate STEM 
(COPUS) (Figure 1) (18).
Observers using COPUS mark specific instructor and 
student behaviors as they occur (such as lecturing and 
listening, respectively). The COPUS codes can be grouped 
into broad categories for instructors (i.e., Presenting, Guiding, 
Administration, and Other) and for students (i.e., Receiving, 
Students Talking to Class, Students Working, and Other) (19). 

During this lesson, more than 50% of the instructor codes 
were ""Guiding,"" which include activities such as posing 
questions, following up with students, moving and guiding 
around the classroom, and answering student questions. For 
the students, approximately 25% of the codes were ""Talking 
to the Class,"" which includes activities such as asking and 
answering questions and making predictions. Another 25% of 
student codes were ""Students Working"" which describes time 
spent answering clicker questions, and working individually 
or with a group",,Formative assessment; Exam; Summative Assessment; Other,Pre/post test,"Students were assessed with formative and summative 
questions aligned to the learning objectives. Formative 
questions included think-pair-share and in-class multiple-
choice questions. Although instructors used different methods 
to poll student answers to multiple-choice questions (including 
colored cards, hand raising, and clickers) all of these types of 
questions have been labeled ""Clicker Questions"" throughout 
the lesson. Supporting File S3: Clicker Questions lists the 
multiple-choice questions and the student response data from 
one class that used clickers. Typical student answers expressed 
during the think-pair-share portions of the activity are included 
in the Progressing Through the Lesson section.
Summative assessment of student thinking was measured 
using multiple-choice and constructed-response pre/post-
test questions, as well as exam questions. The pre/post-test 
was administered online and contained five multiple-choice 
questions and two constructed response questions (Supporting 
File S4: Pre/Post Test Questions). Students were asked to 
complete the assessment questions to the best of their ability 
without the help of outside sources.
The two constructed response questions on the pre/post-test 
were developed for previous assessments to elicit common 
student conceptual difficulties by asking students to explain 
the gain in biomass as a seed grows into a maple tree and how 
planting small quantities of corn seeds can yield exponentially 
more corn by the end of a single season (20,21). The student 
answers to the constructed response questions were scored 
using computer-based lexical analysis tools developed by the 
Automated Analysis of Constructed Response (AACR) group 
(21, 22, http://create4stem.msu.edu/project/aacr), which 
categorizes student answers about the source of biomass. 
The model detects student writing about carbon dioxide, 
water, and nutrients, and combinations of these choices. Two 
authors (MKS and EST) independently coded student answers 
that did not include these sources of biomass into three 
additional categories: a different incorrect source of biomass 
(e.g., sunlight, cell division, soil), nothing about biomass, or 
an unclear source of carbon (e.g., carbon in the atmosphere 
and in the soil). The authors discussed any discrepancies and 
agreed on the final coding.
Students were asked to complete the pre-test in the three 
days preceding the lesson. Students were given approximately 
five days to complete the post-test, starting two days after the 
lesson. Finally, six of the 11 classes included three common 
questions on their final exam (Supporting File S5: Exam 
Questions).",[],Yes,"Cited as supplemental materials, supporting materials, or in an appendix",,Neutral,

This transparent and portable medium, which enables students to document their knowledge and abilities for assessment and career development, has been recognized by the American Association of Colleges and Universities as one of 11 high-impact practices. Using tailored rubrics, student assessment of learning gain surveys, and end-of-course exam questions, this study demonstrates how an ePortfolio assignment can be used in microbiology courses taken by majors and nonmajors to measure student learning outcomes in several course and program learning goals. Additionally, it helps students reflect on their learning and place it in a real-world context by connecting science, microbiology, and microbes with issues of social importance like cholera, gender equity, and antibiotic resistance. Writing from a first-person perspective and drawing on resources obtained in class and from their own research, students generate profiles for a chosen microbe and document the microbe's characteristics in creative ways. The ePortfolio assignment can also be partnered with creative work such as an art piece or a poem that highlights and showcases the microbe in a format that is accessible to the public to increase awareness of the role of microbes in our ecosystems. With careful design and construction of assignments, ePortfolios can also be leveraged to promote civic and scientific literacy by tying classroom content to real-world issues of civic importance.

Prior to class, 3 types of spoiled heat-treated salsa products were
prepared: (a) The incipient spoiled salsa was prepared by allowing
the salsa to spoil at room temperature before the hot water bath
treatment. (b) The underprocessed product was prepared by the
addition of a thermal resistant spore-former, such as a Bacillus spp.
These jars were removed after only 1 to 2 min in the water bath.
(c) The postprocessing contaminated jar was processed along with
the rest of the jars of salsa, but after the water bath treatment, these
jars were left open and a variety of acid tolerant organisms were
added, including yeast and molds as well as bacteria such as E. coli.
Spoiled products were randomly distributed among student
teams. Each team was responsible for stomaching and plating di-
lutions from their respective salsa on trypticase soy agar. After
48 h incubation at 25 Â¬âC, students calculated total plate counts
and noted the number of different colony morphologies.

tubes) of 1 isolate taken from their spoiled product (6 in total).
Pseudomonas, E. coli, and Bacillus subtilis were provided to represent
the incipient, postprocessing, and underprocessing contamination,
respectively. Groups were not told the identity of the organism,
only that it had been previously isolated from their product. For
each organism, groups performed thermal destruction tests at 55,
60, and 65 Â¬âC. Every 5 min (for time points 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, and
25 min) one of their 5 mL tubes was removed from the water baths
and used for dilution and plating. Because students had no prior
knowledge of the heat resistance of their organism, they plated
dilutions of the homogenized salsa from 100 up to 10âÃ Ã­6. After

Students shared the data among all the groups so that differences
in results could be observed. Teams shared total plate counts and
number of unique morphologies. Based on these results, students
made hypotheses about the point in processing at which contam-
ination occurred. 


Students shared the data among all the groups so that differences
in results could be observed and contrasted. Teams shared the raw
data of population counts at each time point per temperature
and individuals performed calculations. Based on these results,
students were asked to draw conclusions about the relative thermal
tolerance of these organisms and whether or not their respective
thermal tolerances indicated they would or would not be able to
survive a thermal process

Students were asked to consider the range of organoleptic
changes they had observed in spoiled food from personal experi-
ence. Then, in the context of the experiment, from the range of
possible sensory changes, students were asked to describe their ob-
servations of the Alicyclobacillus-contaminated apple juice. Students
discussed the significance of a lack of visual change due to spoilage,
and the challenge that it poses to both the detection and consumer
experience. Students were additionally led in a discussion about
the challenges of detection when Alicyclobacillus is present at such
low levels. The discussion was extended for advanced student
groups, and instructors asked students to evaluate the use of de-
tection alone for assessing and limiting microbial spoilage in all
food products or for all organisms. The students determined why
certain products are most associated with Alicyclobacillus and why
its detection in these products is a useful laboratory exercise

of the students in my class have not taken microbiology or 
virology and that this may be the first time they have thought 
about pathogens in any depth.

half-way through the semester. We spend about 30 minutes 
of class time discussing part 1 and part 2.
The third assignment is to design a vaccine using what 
they know about protective immune response to the patho-
gen. This requires the student to synthesize what we have 
discussed in class about vaccines and immune responses 
with what they have learned about their pathogen and 
protective immune responses to design an effective vac-
cine. They must argue the effectiveness of their approach 
compared with other theoretical and current approaches 
to vaccination against the disease. I spend about a lecture 
discussing general approaches to vaccination to help them 
think about their proposal. I also allow 15 to 20 minutes of 
class time for the students to discuss their ideas for their

cohesive proposal. It is important to note that they have 
received feedback from me at after each assignment so that 
they have some idea of what is required. Additionally, each

to execute t-tests to compare the lactose intolerance levels. Two open-ended questions were 
included to guide students with their data interpretation. 
Readiness assessments 
Essentially pop quizzes administered at the beginning a of laboratory session to assess 
studentsâÃÃ´ retention of information. Each assessment contained 3 to 4 questions with an 
assortment of formats including open-ended questions, crossword puzzles, multiple-choice, and 
matching. 
Research proposals 
Microsoft Word templates containing 21 open-ended questions guided students in designing 
their research. Questions focused on background information regarding the research topic, 
hypothesis, experimental design, data collection and analysis, and anticipated outcomes. 
Research proposals were individual assignments during Units 1 and 2, but a group assignment 
during Unit 3.
Posters 
Group assignment using a pre-designed Microsoft PowerPoint template to create mini-posters 
(8.5"" x 11"") to communicate research results at the end of Units 1 and 2. Traditional-sized 
posters (36"" x 24"") were printed at the end of Unit 3.
Lab journals 
Uses a 20-page composition notebook to log details of the research, peer and self-reflections, 
raw data, data analysis, data interpretations, graphs, pictures, concept maps, and any other 
relevant information. Lab journals were collected at the end of each unit for an individual 
grade. New journals were provided to each student prior to starting the Lactase Assay âÃÃ¬

Student-scientist project 
Designed to apply the knowledge and skills acquired during Units 1 and 2 to an experiment 
focusing on enzyme activity, alcohol fermentation, and cell viability. Working collaboratively as 
a research team of four students, each group was required to choose a substrate or inhibitor, 
collect data consecutively over a 3-week period, and present their findings as a final poster 
presentation. The SSP grade was an average of the scores received on the research proposal, 
laboratory journals, and final poster presentation.
Mock poster competition 
review committee
Prior to preparing their first mini-poster, students simulated serving on an 
undergraduate poster presentation competition committee. The purpose of becoming 
members of scientific organizations and attending scientific meetings was discussed.

of three, stratified across academic year and major.
In brief, the 
first blog assignment required students to summarize an 
experiment and pose questions about methodology and 
content; the second assignment required students to add a 
more formal statement of the research hypothesis, more 
completely spell out the methods and results, and identify 
an assumption made by the authors; the third assignment 
required students to add explicit links between hypothesis 
and results and to propose a follow-up experiment rather

IVF is done to overcome infertility problems that some couples experience. Sperm and eggs are collected and fertilized in the lab. (""In vitro"" means ""in glass"" and is used to refer to laboratory conditions.) Fertilized eggs are allowed to divide to form an embryo, which is then implanted in the mother. During the 1980s, scientists began developing procedures for characterizing the genetic makeup of embryos created by IVF in a process known as preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD). Detection of chromosomal abnormalities that may lead to miscarriage and single gene disorders for certain diseases are among the reasons for performing this procedure. Once the genetic makeup of the embryo has been determined, the parents can then decide if they want it to be implanted. Those that are not implanted can be discarded or frozen. This article describes a classroom activity that can be used with high school or college students and would be done at the end of a unit on genetics.

The power of this activity is achieved when students complete

Debates are shown to foster communication skills, teamwork, 
and are effective mechanisms to educate moral sensitivity

student-led interactions encourage the exchange of ideas from 
a variety of perspectives. Further, students can achieve a greater 
understanding of content through the instructional strategy of 
role-playing, such as that used within an analytical chemistry 
setting (24), through the integration of biological and social 
information (25), or when making history come alive (26). As 
previously described, role-playing in the sciences begins with 
an individual research assignment leading into a seminar where 
students assume various roles as they become scientists (27).",,Presentation; Worksheet; Other,"Pre-class homework (summary files), teamwork skills, post-class reflection","Assessment
As Fennessey illustrates, it is important to establish 
assessment expectations for a role-playing exercise (28). 
These expectations require the integration of tools such as 
scripts, debates, and storytelling to effectively communicate 
ideas. This is most effective when students are accountable 
for individual preparation and research. In larger enrollment 
courses, a prescriptive worksheet can be used to make notes 
on the presentations for later individual reflections or to assign 
participation points. Reflective experiences are necessary to 
provide closure to the role-playing experience, particularly when 
attempting to understand the history or sociology of science 
as part of an interdisciplinary curriculum (28). In our case, we 
have modeled a similar experience. Each student has a specific 
role to research prior to class. They are expected to examine the 
person as well as query the suggested reference and summary 
facts provided in Supporting File 1 (Supporting File S1: HeLa 
Hearing - Perspective profiles). From here, students are directed 
to prepare summary files for submission at the beginning of 
the class period in which the hearing is conducted (Supporting 
File S4: HeLa Hearing âÃÃ¬ Pre-class homework). Instructors have 
the option of scoring this pre-class assignment for a grade 
(Supporting File S7: HeLa Hearing âÃÃ¬ Grading rubric). Importantly, 
students who do not complete their pre-class homework will be 
unable to provide meaningful contributions to the discussion. 
To encourage homework compliance, instructors may choose 
to score students on their oral presentation and teamwork skills 
(Supporting File S7: HeLa Hearing âÃÃ¬ Grading rubric). However, 
the more insightful assessment is the post-class reflection. 
This written assignment allows students to consider what was 
presented at the hearing and arrive at their own informed 
position. Teachers may grade this submission for both stylistic 
(grammar, syntax, etc.) as well as the logic or rationale of their 
position. A grading rubric is provided (Supporting File S5: HeLa

A common project involves students researching and presenting a disease to the class. This method alone is not very effective, and course evaluations have consistently indicated that students felt they lacked adequate disease knowledge; therefore, a more hands-on and interactive disease project was developed called Microbial Murders. For this team-based project, a group of students chooses a pathogen, researches the disease, creates a ""mugshot"" of the pathogen, and develops a corresponding ""crime scene,"" where a hypothetical patient has died from the microbe. Each group gives a presentation introducing the microbial pathogen, signs/symptoms, treatments, and overall characteristics. The students then visit each other's crime scenes to match the pathogen with the correct crime scene by critically thinking through the clues. This project has shown remarkable success. Surveys indicate that 73% of students thought the project helped them understand the material and 84% said it was worth their time. Student participation, excitement, understanding, and application of microbial disease knowledge have increased and are evident through an increase in course evaluations and in student assessment scores. This project is easy to implement and can be used in a wide variety of biology, microbiology, or health classes for any level (middle school through college).",1433,Steel 2017,Colorado State University-Pueblo,,Colorado State University-Pueblo,"sophomore level Introduction to Microbiology

Upon completion of this project, students will be 
able to: 
1. Assemble core microbiology and pathogen knowl-
edge into clearly designed clues and evidence lead-
ing to a particular microbial disease. 
2. Examine and analyze other studentsâÃÃ´ clues and 
scenes in order to critically identify the corre-
sponding pathogen. 
3. Explain and describe the impact of microbial 
pathogens on human health and differentiate 
specific details for a wide variety of common 
microbial diseases. 
Assessment of student learning outcomes through 
post-participation surveys has indicated student enthusiasm, 
excitement, and appreciation for this project. Data and 
scores on a microbial pathogen disease quiz indicate that 
those participating in the crime scene investigation com-
prehend significantly more about the microbes than those 
just listening to presentations. Additionally, scores on their 
final unit exam (covering microbial diseases) have increased 
since the implementation of this project.",,"The Microbial Murders: A Crime Scene Investigation 
project involves three main components (as introduced in 
the student instructions section): a presentation, a mugshot, 
and a crime scene. The presentations are similar to what 
has been used in traditional disease presentations, but 
the utility and context of the microbial murders seems to 
make the presentations more exciting and relevant. These 
presentations are initiated by the instructor standing up 
and welcoming the students to the ""debriefing"" meeting. A 
grave announcement is made that there have been X num-
ber of fatalities (based on the number of disease teams for 
the particular semester). The instructor then continues to 
introduce the presentations by saying that the students will 
have the opportunity to learn about the potential microbial 
murderers and that it is their job to help identify the cause 
of death. It is advised that the students pay attention and 
take notes, which will help them correctly solve the crime 
scenes. This introduction really gets the students excited 
to learn and to listen. The students take notes and ask 
questions because they know that they will have to apply 
this knowledge in a very real setting. Depending on the size 
of the class, these presentations can be done in a group 
for the whole class (peer or instructor graded, Appendix 
8), or the teams can divide up with a representative from 
each disease in a group and present the microbial suspects 
in a smaller setting, in which case the presentation is peer-
graded (10,11).","I'm not sure if the activity should be considered a game, live-action visual, or something else",Exam; Presentation; Quiz; Worksheet; Other,"Project (""crime scene"")","Assessment of student learning outcomes through

excitement, and appreciation for this project. Data and

those participating in the crime scene investigation com-
prehend significantly more about the microbes than those 
just listening to presentations. Additionally, scores on their 
final unit exam (covering microbial diseases) have increased 
since the implementation of this project.

Student learning has been assessed using a variety of 
different methods. A microbial disease quiz (Appendices 5 
and 6) is given following the ""debriefing"" meeting to measure 
the level of understanding gained from presentations alone. 
A similar disease quiz is then given following solving the 
crime scenes and can be used to measure the learning gains 
that occur due to solving the crime scenes. This disease quiz 
partially helps assess learning objective (LO) 3 to measure 
the studentsâÃÃ´ comprehension of microbial pathogens. In ad-
dition to the disease quiz, more open-ended essay questions 
are included in the unit 4 and final exams that can be used 
to measure learning gains. The ""Solving the crime scene"" 
worksheet (Appendix 4) is a valuable tool for assessing how 
well the groups do at analyzing and critically thinking through 
the clues. Each group works on a single worksheet that 
they take from scene to scene. Students demonstrate their 
comprehension by correctly identifying the microbe respon-
sible for the crime scene as well as describing what could 
have been done to prevent or treat the disease. StudentsâÃÃ´ 
responses on the ""Solving the crime scene"" worksheet can 
be used to assess LO2. The crime scenes are graded using 
the rubric (Appendix 3) and can also be used to measure 
the level of comprehension of the responsible group based 
on the quality and depth of thinking required to solve the 
clues (LO1). Performance on the corresponding unit exam 
and/or final exam has also been used as a metric to assess 
the efficacy of this disease project.",,Yes,"Cited as supplemental materials, supporting materials, or in an appendix",,Neutral,

One component of each student's grade on this activity is based on his or her effort and level of 
participation. A student's effort and participation score is based on my overall assessment of an 
individual's active participation in group discussions, and data collection and analysis. Students are also 
graded on completeness of data tables and worksheets, and accuracy of calculations, and either a short 
(approximately five double-spaced pages) paper written in the format of a professional scientific journal 
(biology majors) or the quality of written answers to questions based on this experiment (nonscience 
majors). 
Most students in my general ecology class are sophomore and junior biology majors. Many of them have 
had few prior opportunities to use statistical tools to analyze their own data. Additionally, some of these 
students have not yet written a scientific paper. Therefore, I direct much effort toward helping students 
feel comfortable with statistics and scientific writing techniques. We complete two examples of a paired-
sample t test, and discuss how to interpret results from this test (see âÃÃ²Student Data Set #1âÃÃ´, and t-test help

what should be included in each section of their own paper. A handout and checklist of scientific paper 
components assist with this (see âÃÃ²Appendix 1âÃÃ´). Students are informed that I refer to this checklist of

After completing their research, worksheets, and slides 
independently, students come together for a 50-minute 
discussion section to share the highlights of their species. This 
discussion is one of the most inclusive moments in the entire 
course because it brings together the perspectives of over 30 
students instead of the perspective of one instructor. Many 
students choose to share species that interest them personally, 
so the presentations offer an opportunity for self-expression.
In our experience, the activity appears to foster a sense of 
community among the students as they learn about each otherâÃÃ´s 
interests and have fun together. However, giving the presentation 
can be intimidating for some students, especially those with 
anxiety or for whom English is a second language. For that 
reason, we structured the activity to support those students. 
When I (Stockwell) give the IAs directions on how to run the 
in-person version of the discussion section, I emphasize that 
they should let students present while sitting at their desks if 
they prefer. Students also have their worksheets in front of them 
and can read from them if they feel nervous about speaking 
spontaneously. The IA is in charge of projecting the studentsâÃÃ´ 
slides so the students do not need to worry about the technology. 
The presentations are graded only on completion. With all those 
supports in place, the presentations represent a low-stakes way 
for students to practice the important skill of speaking in front of 
a group. If you have students with such severe anxiety that they 
cannot present even under these circumstances, you could offer 
them the opportunity to pre-record a presentation, as described 
in the online version of the activity.
The activity asks students to speak, listen, look, and (in the 
worksheet) write, thus offering many ways for students to engage 
their senses and demonstrate what they can do. Students get to 
hear about biodiversity from over 30 different perspectives, in 
over 30 different voices, and each student participates equally 
in the lesson. The result is a multifaceted, inclusive ""nature 
documentary"" created collaboratively by and for the students 
themselves.",,,Yes,,Yes,,"Learning Goals

describe the ecology and natural history of their chosen species.
âÃÂ¢ 
describe human effects on their species and its habitat.

of organismal diversity.",,"The lesson has three components. Each student 1) does 
Internet research to choose a species, learn about it, and 
complete a written worksheet; 2) makes a simple slide depicting 
their species; and 3) gives a short oral presentation about the 
species to their peers. The first two components happen before 
class and the third takes place in the discussion section. All 
three components are active and student-driven. Since each 
student chooses their species, students have ownership of the 
project, and many students take the opportunity to follow their 
personal interests. When students feel a sense of ownership of 
their project, they tend to be more excited and interested in 
the topic (19).",,Formative assessment; Presentation; Worksheet; Other,"PowerPoint slide, clicker questions","Assessment
The primary goal of this activity is to increase studentsâÃÃ´ 
engagement in the topic of biodiversity and their appreciation 
of the variety of species on our planet. In keeping with this 
goal, IAs assess students on completion rather than correctness 
for the slide and the oral presentation. The IAs also grade the 
worksheet, giving credit for answers that look credible and are 
consistent with the IAsâÃÃ´ knowledge of biology, since the IAs are 
not experts on all the different species students choose. (If you 
wish to be more rigorous, you could institute a peer-review 
system where students fact-check each otherâÃÃ´s worksheets.) The 
worksheet asks students to locate their species on a phylogenetic 
tree and IAs grade this question on correctness. The knowledge 
that other students will be watching their presentations provides 
incentive for students to put extra effort into finding an intriguing 
species and discovering fun facts about it that will interest their 
classmates.
In addition, I (Stockwell) used iClicker questions in the whole-
class lecture to assess studentsâÃÃ´ experience of the activity and

We chose this topic partly due to the explosion of recent research in this area, as well as the opportunity to expose students to online tools and techniques. Student motivation arose from the opportunity to determine the types of microbes that might be growing inside their mouth, and piqued their interest in how microbes could positively affect their health. Through a series of activities, a group of students from a large-enrollment course sampled and analyzed a subset of their oral microflora. Using the NCBI BLAST tool, they were able to tentatively identify microbial sequences amplified using primers specific for 16S rRNA. The activities greatly expanded on topics covered only briefly in lecture and provided hands-on experience with scientific techniques.

helped them work together to solve the more technical 
aspects of the experiment as outlined in the module 
(Supplemental File S1). We anticipated that some students 
would choose not to swab their own mouth and were 
prepared to provide them with a previously isolated DNA 
sample. Using this DNA sample, they could participate in 
the BLAST search and analysis. Had students chosen not 
to swab their oral cavity, they could make observations 
from a fellow classmateâÃÃ´s plates, provided they did not 
handle an opened plate themselves. This is in compliance 
with the biological safety policy at the University of MN. 
Students are allowed to handle cultured samples of their 
own body microflora because it is presumably part of their 
own normal flora. However, they must still wear personal 
protective equipment when handling cultured bacteria, 
including long pants, closed-toed shoes, disposable gloves, 
eye protection and a laboratory coat. We were pleased to 
note that all of our students participated and were able to 
identify a diversity of microbes in their mouths. In order 
for students to more fully appreciate this diversity, the de-
identified results were pooled and shared between the two 
sections that participated in the pilot study. Students were 
able to observe the differences between the two sections 
and think about how this difference might impact human 
health and disease. 
Teaching assistant training
All of the introductory biology courses at the University of 
MN are large-enrollment courses, with over 200 students in 
each lecture section. These students are divided into at least 
twelve lab sections with 20 students each. We typically rely on 
teaching assistants (TAs) to take the lead on instruction for the 
laboratory-based aspects of the course. The TAs for our course 
were either upper level science majors at the top of their class 
in ranking, or graduate students hired as teaching assistants. 
In either case, the TAs must have successfully completed an 
anatomy and physiology course and show competence in 
anatomy and physiology. In addition, our TAs typically have at 
least one semester of research experience. 
For this module, although the authors of the activity (AKS, 
KBV) were primarily responsible for presenting the biological 
concepts, it was done in conjunction with the TAs who took 
the lead in running the laboratory sections. The TAs in the 
laboratory sections undergo a weeklong training session with 
the course instructor and lab manager prior to the start of the 
semester. During the semester, they attend weekly training 
meetings lead by an experienced head TA, who was also one of 
the TAs involved in teaching the Oral Microflora module. These 
weekly training meetings include a discussion of upcoming 
activities and any potential problems that might arise. The 
authors of this activity worked with the two TAs leading the 
Oral Microflora sections at least one week in advance of 
the activity being presented to students to train them on the 
experimental techniques and answer any questions or safety 
concerns for the TAs. This preparation provided the TAs with a 
level of comfort with the activity but did not necessarily make 
them experts in all aspects of microbiology. Senior lab staff was 
always available during laboratory sections to lend assistance 
for troubleshooting technical problems that TAs were unable 
to handle themselves (usually involving focusing on bacteria).
A word on safety
This activity requires students to work with bacteria cultured 
from inside the surface of their mouths. The safety policies of 
the University of MN allow students to handle bacteria isolated 
from their own bodies as long as they observe appropriate 
safety precautions. This assumes that the bacteria isolated from 
their body surfaces are part of their own personal microflora 
and should not pose a threat to them. The precautions required 
include wearing personal protective equipment such as 
disposable gloves, goggles, lab coats, long pants and closed-
toed shoes whenever they are working with cultured bacteria. 
If biological safety is a concern, this activity could be modified 
by skipping the culturing steps and providing students with 
sequences to analyze from the database. We would still 
recommend doing a cheek swab on day one and staining the 
slide with methylene blue to compare the bacterial cells to 
cheek epithelial cells. We did not observe any safety issues 
during the running of this module in the fall of 2012, or again 
when the activity was presented in the summer of 2013 to 
secondary-school science teachers",,,Yes,,Yes,,"

questions asked on the mid-term lab practical exam (see 
Supplemental File S6). More importantly, students self-
evaluated their learning at a number of stages. They assessed 
their learning of technical skills by determining whether 
they had growth on their colony plates, whether appropriate 
bands could be visualized in their gel after PCR, and if they 
had obtained DNA sequences to analyze. They were able 
to assess learning of computational skills through their

divided into at least twelve lab sections with 20 students 
each. It would not be possible for a single instructor to be 
present at all lab sections, as well as teach the three lectures 
per week in two different lecture sections of the course. As 
such, we rely on our teaching assistants (TAs) to take the lead 
in providing the laboratory-based components of the course. 
The TAs for our course were either upper level science majors 
at the top of their class in academic ranking, or graduate 
students hired as teaching assistants. In either case, the TAs 
must have successfully completed an anatomy and physiology 
course and show competence in anatomy and physiology. 
In addition, our TAs typically have at least one semester of 
research experience.
For this module, although two of the authors (AKS, MAW) sat 
in on two laboratory sections throughout the six week activity, 
we felt it was important to allow the TAs to continue to have 
the leadership role in their sections. This six-week module had 
the added benefit of allowing the TAs an opportunity to further 
develop their science teaching skills.
Given our use of TAs in the laboratory, it is important that 
they have appropriate training to address any questions or 
problems that might arise in the process. As a part of TA training, 
TAs completed a weeklong training session with the course 
instructor and lab manager prior to the start of the semester. 
During the semester, they attended weekly training meetings 
lead by an experienced head TA who had been involved with 
the course for two years. These meetings included discussions 
of upcoming activities, the potential for any problems and 
how to deal with issues that may arise. These weekly meetings 
were also an opportunity for the TAs to share their insights and 
suggestions with one another.
In the weeks prior to the start of the six-week module 
described below, training was provided for the TAs on the 
iWorx equipment. Several of the TAs had used the equipment 
previously, and for those TAs it was a chance to refresh their 
skills and to test the iWorx tutorial we had developed for use 
by the students. This preparation provided the TAs a level of 
comfort with the iWorx equipment but did not necessarily 
make them an expert in all aspects of the equipment. For 
troubleshooting technical problems that the TAs were unable 
to handle themselves, senior lab staff was always available 
during laboratory sections to lend assistance.
For the purpose of this activity, we specifically instructed 
the TAs to troubleshoot experimental problems only at the 
general level (e.g. helping students to think about how they 
would quickly attach electrodes to a research participant after 
an aerobic activity), but not to predict results or to say that an 
experiment was not worth doing. We wanted to allow students 
the freedom to propose and execute experiments even if 
we knew it was unlikely that the students would observe a 
difference between treatment groups. We did not intentionally 
want experiments to fail, but this failure was a potential part of 
the experimental design process. The research was still new for 
the students, and they were able to perform simple statistical 
analyses with their data. For issues relating to experimental 
design or hypothesis development, students and TAs could 
consult with the instructor or post-doctoral fellows, as well 
as any of the TAs or support staff. Although this additional 
support was not always physically present in the labs, one or 
more individuals were available in nearby rooms if needed 
during the labs.",,,Yes,,Yes,,"Learning Goal(s)

Students will be able to:
âÃÂ¢ 
Read current scientific literature
âÃÂ¢ 
Formulate testable hypotheses
âÃÂ¢ 
Design an experimental procedure to test their hypothesis

data, and present the results to their peers.",,Formative assessment; Paper / report / problem set; Presentation; Quiz,,"""Assessment
âÃÂ¢ 
Student learning is measured by instructors through 
questions on a lab quiz after the Jigsaw activity 
(Supplemental S2), to determine their understanding of the 
basic aspects of the scientific process. Student learning is 
assessed through rubrics used to assess their experimental 
design and final presentations (Supplementals S4 and S8, 
respectively). Pre- and post-quizzes may be given to assess 
learning gains related to the scientific skills and processes.
âÃÂ¢ 
Students self-evaluate their learning through the 
development and revision of the experimental design. This 
portion of the activity is done in two parts, with students 
bringing in a rough draft of the experimental protocol that 
is refined after discussions with the laboratory teaching 
assistant.""



""Assessments: After completing the jigsaw activity, students 
were given a short quiz on reading scientific literature and 
the components of experimental design. For consistency with 
other lab quizzes, this was given as a multiple choice quiz, 
representing foundational level BloomâÃÃ´s skills. The questions 
we asked are provided in Supplemental File S2, along with the 
answer key. These questions could be modified as needed to 
fit the research model used in the class setting. As a formative 
assessment for how students were feeling about the research 
experience at this point, we also asked students to provide a 
response to the following statement: ""Write one to two words 
that come to mind when you think about designing your own 
experiment"". We compiled student responses from each lab 
section into one document and created a WordCloud using 
the online software tool available at wordle.net. The results of 
this impromptu survey, shown in Figure 1, were shared with 
the students at the next lab session.""



""Assessments: By the end of this lab period, student teams 
had a chance to work through their experimental protocol and to receive feedback on their protocol from their TA. The 
Experimental Design Rubric provided in Supplemental 4 
was used by the TAs to evaluate the experimental protocols. 
This assessment correlates with application and creation 
level BloomâÃÃ´s skills, as students were required to apply the 
knowledge and skills gained during the first two weeks of the 
module, as well as create their own hypothesis to test. ""



""Assessments: The culmination of this six-week module 
is the creation of oral presentations by individual Research 
Teams to present their research findings. Most students chose 
to use PowerPoint as their presentation platform, although 
this was not a requirement. Presentations were evaluated by 
TAs using the grading rubric provided in Supplemental File 
S8. We measured application and analysis level BloomâÃÃ´s 
skills, assessing the ability of students to apply the knowledge 
learned throughout the module in order to collect and analyze 
data. Students were also expected to synthesize and evaluate 
their data and experimental design, to determine whether their 
hypothesis was supported by the data collected.
To assess learning gains on scientific process skills, we 
administered a pre/post-survey using questions derived from 
the TOSLS assessment tool (9). This assessment was done during 
the lecture portion of the course. The survey was administered 
one week prior to and one week after completing the six week 
laboratory module. The survey was presented in a multiple 
choice format, measuring foundational knowledge as well as 
the ability to analyze graphical data.""",,Yes,"Cited as supplemental materials, supporting materials, or in an appendix",,Neutral,

It is also increasingly important for undergraduate programs in ecology and related disciplines to provide students with experiences working with large ecological datasets to develop students' data science skills and their ability to consider how ecological processes that operate at broader spatial scales (macroscale) affect local ecosystems. To support the goals of improving student understanding of macroscale ecology and biodiversity at multiple spatial scales, we formed an interdisciplinary team that included grant personnel, scientists, and faculty from ecology and spatial sciences to design a flexible learning activity to teach macroscale biodiversity concepts using large datasets from the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON).

In upper level courses, I typically require that all groups turn in a lab notebook documenting the
groupâÃÃ´s thought processes and initial experimental setup (i.e., after completion of Phases I and
II). Providing formative feedback on each groupâÃÃ´s initial hypothesis and level of procedural
detail can be valuable early in the course so that students familiarize themselves with any lab
notebook grading rubric and to help the instructor assess studentsâÃÃ´ comfort level with
hypothesis development in a lower-stakes situation.
I have previously based summative assessment of the overall project in upper level courses on
the lab notebook after the completion of the conclusions phase. Lab Notebook Rubric shown
on the next two pages was used for assessment in this case. The Participation category is used
to separately grade each member of the group. Since individual group members rotated the
note-taking role in this course, ""Credit"" for each memberâÃÃ´s contributions is also included for
that role as a necessary criterion to facilitate Participation grading.
When implementing this lab in introductory biology, I have expected students to keep a lab
notebook but based summative assessment on a group lab report. The Lab Report Rubric,
shown after the first rubric, was applied to this and all other group lab reports throughout the
semester. Note that the Lab Notebook Rubric and Lab Report Rubric are not intended for use

(accuracy and completeness of background). Extensive 
feedback is provided on elements of scientific writing, 
including sentence and paragraph structure, formatting of the 
references and in-text citations, third person narrative, etc. 
Formatting is determined by the required text, ""A Short Guide 
to Writing in Biology"" (22).
The materials and methods section of the laboratory 
notebook is based on the protocol given in the lab handouts. 
However, there are often places where students need to 
provide additional details not provided in the handouts. For 
instance, the lab handout might say to ""pour an agarose 
gel"" whereas each studentâÃÃ´s materials and methods section 
should explicitly write out the directions for this, including the 
amount of agarose and the volume of buffer. This is intended 
to provide a framework for experimental protocols but also 
provide an opportunity for students to solve problems and 
apply their skills and knowledge. The students in this setting 
have experience with basic lab techniques from at least four 
previous laboratory courses, as well as in the early weeks of 
this course, and therefore, are more than capable of transferring 
those skills to this laboratory. Students with less experience will 
likely need to be provided with more resources and guidance 
during and immediately before each exercise. I have recently 
began providing some content on the course website several 
days before the labs are due to provide additional guidance 
through areas that are troublesome for students (Supporting 
File S1: CRISPR in Yeast - Lectures). Additional mini-lectures 
by the instructor at the start of each lab often help students 
complete or correct misconceptions or errors in the protocol. 
Students are also encouraged to consult with peers to address 
any inconsistencies in the materials and methods, prior to 
performing experiments. To minimize time spent grading the 
materials and methods, the instructor may grade for simple 
completion or choose 1-3 elements (e.g., reaction conditions, 
culture volumes) within the materials and methods to assess.
From the instructor perspective, the expected results 
portion of the lab notebook provides the most information on 
conceptual understanding. Students are expected to develop 
a hypothesis, a critical element for an authentic research 
experience, but also, to be able to visualize the product(s) of 
the assay based on this hypothesis. A common mistake is to 
state the hypothesized conclusion, but not actually describe 
the evidence that will support or reject the hypothesis. I have 
had success limiting the expected results to a few sentences, 
and even encouraging students sketch their anticipated data.
The final piece of notebook assessment is the results and 
data interpretation. The results are checked for completion 
(and feedback provided) in the week following the lab, but 
are collected and stringently graded twice during the semester. 
The format of results is standardized as much as possible 
according to the required writing text (22). For example, all 
figures must have a figure number, descriptive title, legend and 
be fully labeled. The results should be described in text, and 
the meaning or interpretation of the results discussed. When 
experiments fail, students are asked to hypothesize reasons 
for this, and describe a potential solution for this problem. 
Some students recognize this exercise of data interpretation 
and troubleshooting as helpful in development and practice 
of critical thinking skills: ""I will carry with me confidence in 
troubleshooting experiments, drawing my own conclusions..."", 
""I think this course helped me with critical thinking, especially 
if something in the experiment went wrong, I was required to 
think about what could have possibly gone wrong and how I 
could fix it if I was going to redo it.""
Exams
The students are assessed for their understanding of topics 
with two formal exams. The first exam is given the week 
following the dry lab design exercise (Table 1 Lesson Plan 
Timeline). The topics included in this exam are discussed and 
practiced in the introductory laboratory exercises (i.e., sterile 
technique, DNA isolation, restriction enzyme digest, agarose 
gel electrophoresis, etc.) and, importantly, in the practical 
design of CRISPR-based experiments in yeast. The assessment 
is both practical and formal. For the practical portion, students 
are asked to describe how to do techniques, or to perform 
exercises parallel to those done in class. For example, they 
are asked to retrieve sequence information from genome 
databases, design guide RNA that will target CRISPR/Cas9 
to knock-out gene expression from a given gene, describe 
how to streak a plate for individual colonies, etc. The exam 
also assesses the studentsâÃÃ´ retention of concepts discussed in 
the lab, including their understanding of the purpose and/or 
principle behind techniques and solutions (Supporting File S2: 
CRISPR in Yeast - Sample Assessments). Students are assessed 
after the design of their CRISPR-based experiments, but before 
its application to allow the students and instructors to proceed 
confidently with the CRISPR experiments, but also to provide 
instructors with time to prepare and order materials necessary 
for the student-designed portion of the project.
A final practical exam assesses student understanding of 
laboratory methods, reagents, and practices relevant to the 
gene editing. This exam takes place the same week that formal 
lab reports are also due, with the goal of assessing assimilation 
of knowledge that was compiled in the formal report 
(Supporting File S2: CRISPR in Yeast - Sample Assessments).
Formal Lab Reports
Each student must write a formal lab report over the entire 
CRISPR gene editing in yeast laboratory exercise. These 
reports are modeled after a primary research article, with an 
introduction, materials and methods, results, and discussion. 
To encourage early writing, limited portions of the lab reports 
are turned into the instructor as early as week 2. The material 
assessed in these early drafts is limited (i.e., materials and 
methods from cloning week 1, or results from cloning lab 
2), to limit load on the instructor and students. The drafts are 
low stakes (points awarded for completion) and feedback is 
designed to provide progressive guidance on scientific writing. 
Specific instruction in science writing is provided during 
portions of the laboratory with wait times (i.e., incubations). 
The lab report rubric (Supporting File S5: CRISPR in Yeast - 
Lab Report Rubric) is provided to the students during these 
discussions. Instructor feedback can be streamlined with the 
rubric. It is also possible to orchestrate peer-reviews of drafts 
during the laboratory section, or outside of class.
The lab reports provide an opportunity to assess the ability of 
students to communicate their understanding of the laboratory 
procedure, goals and outcomes to an audience of their peers. 
This communication is a pillar of the authentic research 
experience (1). Indeed, students report significant gains in 
their ability to and comfort with scientific writing (Figure 3B). 
Moreover, the lab report is an opportunity to compile the 
separate pieces of the exercise, making connections between 
the content and skills gained through the weeks. Students 
report significant gains in the ability to make these connections 
(Figure 3A), likely due, in large part, to lab reports. One 
student commented, ""The lab report forced me to understand 
the bigger picture of what we did throughout the entire course 
of the semester.""",,Yes,"Cited as supplemental materials, supporting materials, or in an appendix",,Easy,

about scientists, including women and people of color who 
are often underrepresented in sciences, conducting research 
directly related to course content (24). Scientist spotlights have 
been shown to lead to increased student understanding of and

âÃÂ¢ 
In this course, students will explore three current topics in biology 
that are widely discussed by the news media, portrayed in some 
popular television shows and movies, and used to make important 
scientific policy decisions: stem cells and cloning, genetically 
modified organisms, and the human genome and human genetic 
diseases. All three of these topics are likely to have significant 
impacts on studentsâÃÃ´ lives, potentially affecting decisions about 
medical treatments, the environment, and food choices. 
âÃÂ¢ 
Students will practice evaluating scientific content and uncovering 
appropriate and relevant content.
âÃÂ¢ 
Students will enjoy reading and learning how biology relates to 
everyday life and want to talk to others about what they learn to 
make scientific and policy connections outside of the classroom.
âÃÂ¢ 
Students will continue to read science articles from Discover 
Magazine, Scientific American, or the New York Times or listen to 
RadioLab and Story Collider after the course is over.


Learning Objective(s)
For each specific topic (stem cells and cloning, genetically modified 
organisms, and the human genome and human genetic diseases), 
students will be able to: 
âÃÂ¢ 
describe the underlying biology and explore how scientific 
reasoning and methods develop this understanding,
âÃÂ¢ 
discuss the types of policy decisions that regulate studies related to 
biology or its application to human or environmental health, 
âÃÂ¢ 
evaluate scientific information to distinguish reliable information 
from propaganda, 
âÃÂ¢ 
explain how scientific controversies can arise when the same 
scientific questions are approached in different ways, 
âÃÂ¢ 
explore why some types of biological issues trigger regulatory 
decisions that can affect both research that would deepen our 
understanding of the issue and application of the results to policy 
decisions,

Students completed a pre- and post-survey to identify their 
sources of science news. Formative assessments (40% of final 
grade) included daily reading assignments (from science news 
articles and parts of three textbooks) with students responding 
to two or three questions based on daily learning outcomes 
before class on the online learning management system (21). 
On alternate weeks students either completed an online quiz 
designed to promote transfer (22,23) or a scientist spotlight to 
read and write about scientists conducting research related to 
course content (24) or to counteract some of the potentially 
negative media representation of scientists (19). Across the 
course students completed three summative assessments 
during the term, one for each unit (60% of final grade): they 
wrote a letter to their elected officials about stem cells or 
cloning (25); played a Reacting to the Past game focused on 
genetically modified foods (26); and for the final take home 
final reflected on their learning in the course, found a new 
scientist to spotlight who conducts research related to the 
course, and located and wrote about a recent science news 
article. Summative assessments were aligned to course 
goals and outcomes and developed using best practices of 
transparent design (27).




Formative Assessments
Students completed structured formative assessments (40% 
of final grade), both in and out of class, to read and engage with 
science in the news and build capacity for critical analysis and 
metacognition. First, twice a week, students completed daily 
readings and answered two or three online questions on the 
learning management system. Questions were based on daily 
learning outcomes and created a framework so students were 
familiar with the basics of the content before class (21).
Second, students engaged with daily readings in class 
through individual and group assignments, worksheets, 
discussions, and clicker questions. Activities were explicitly 
designed to support studentsâÃÃ´ deep engagement with the 
content, develop transferrable metacognitive skills related to 
consuming science news (such as source quality and easy reference of original primary literature), and practice extracting 
information from news articles. Third, students completed five 
online multiple-choice quizzes every other week. Quizzes 
included images directly from popular press articles students 
had not yet read and required transfer of knowledge to new 
situations (22,23). Quizzes also included short passages from 
news articles that students interpreted.
Lastly, students wrote five scientist spotlight reflections 
focused on scientists doing research directly related to course 
content (24). In each scientist spotlight, a video of the scientist 
discussing their research was paired with a popular press 
reading that included societal implications of the research. 
In each of these formative assessments, students practiced 
communicating both with classmates and in writing to 
answer questions about what they were learning. Students 
and instructors received feedback through these formative 
assessments about studentsâÃÃ´ abilities to read and interpret 
material and successfully answer questions related to course 
goals.

Summative Assessments
Students completed three summative assessments (60% of 
final grade), and as part of a final take home exam students 
located and wrote about a recent science news article. 
Summative assessments were aligned to course goals and 
developed using best practices of transparent design (27). The 
final take home exam related to science news reading and was 
designed to assess how well students had developed critical 
reading skills and the ability to demonstrate the metacognition 
targeted by formative assessments and classroom activities 
throughout the quarter (Supporting File S3. Science News - 
Summative Assessment). After describing how they located an 
article and their reasons for trusting the source, students wrote 
a short essay response to specific questions about the article. 
The grading rubric included evaluation of studentsâÃÃ´ responses 
using nine criteria: 1) complete citation; 2) description of 
how the article was located; 3) description of the quality 
of the article; 4) summary of the science; 5) connections 
to the course; 6) description of how the science was well-
represented; 7) description how the science was poorly-
represented; 8) thoughtful questions for the author; and 9) 
grammar and mechanics.

Final Summative Assessment
Ninety-three students completed the final exam and cited 81 
separate articles from 28 unique sources. Twenty-three articles 
were from The New York Times, 12 from Scientific American
, 
10 from Science Daily, and 9 from Science News. Of the other 
top sources that we read for class, students cited zero from 
Nature News and three each from government websites and 
Science
.
Students identified six main emerging criteria that they used 
to select a science news article for their final exam:
âÃÂ¢ 
read other articles from the same source earlier in the 
course;
âÃÂ¢ 
included citations of peer-reviewed research;
âÃÂ¢ 
credible or reputable;
âÃÂ¢ 
unbiased;
âÃÂ¢ 
written in a format that was easy to understand; or
âÃÂ¢ 
recommended by a trusted associate.
Students listed their rationale for trusting the conclusions 
from the article based on:
âÃÂ¢ 
citations of peer-reviewed research or
âÃÂ¢ 
from a reputable or credible source.
Students demonstrated a range of abilities for describing 
why the source they selected was reputable. Exemplary student 
answers included multiple criteria, provided evidence from 
the article to support their criteria, and clearly demonstrated 
that the student engaged in metacognition while evaluating 
the credibility of the news article (Table 3). Student answers 
that were less-well developed might have used some of the 
key wording (e.g., credible or unbiased) without defining the 
terms or providing an example from the article, and it was 
unclear whether the student engaged in metacognition of 
their own biases or learning when evaluating the quality of 
the article. In the least well-developed answers, students could 
not articulate what criteria they used to select an article in a 
way that showed discrimination between excellent and poor-
quality science news writing.",,Yes,"Cited as supplemental materials, supporting materials, or in an appendix",,Easy,

3-4 weeks (""scaffolding""), as part of a unit within the De-
velopmental Neurobiology course. Students chose their 
paper preferences after 1st class session, which gave an 
overview of the unitâÃÃ´s topic. Literature that could be cho-
sen included seminal papers that focused on concepts and 
techniques covered by the unit overview. Students were 
assigned one of their top three paper choices by the end of 
the 2nd class session. Groups of 2-3 students would be 
assigned the same paper so they would be able to work 
with each other in evaluating it; at the same time, each 
student in the group would often wish to focus on one as-
pect of the paper to minimize content overlap in their 
presentations, though this was not required by the activity 
prompt. Before the 3rd class session, students each wrote 
a title and abstract for their presentation, geared toward a 
non-expert audience. Before the 4th class session, they 
submitted a ""rough draft""âÃÃ®a scan or photo of their cocktail 
napkin as it looked at the end of a practice presentation. 
By this point in the activity, students were working on this 
activity outside of class; most in-class time up to this point 
was devoted to delivering interactive lectures of the unitâÃÃ´s 
topic and discussion of 1-2 assigned papers related to the 
topic. These class-wide papers were chosen to include 
concepts and techniques found in studentsâÃÃ´ chosen pa-
pers. Before the 5th class session, the presentation was 
prepared for ""Practice Day"", a full 75-minute class period 
devoted to peer presentation and practice in the groups of 
2-3 who were assigned the same paper, providing immedi-
ate peer feedback. The instructor rotated among the small 
groups, listening for strengths and weaknesses in individu-
al presentations, and offering candid feedback. The stu-
dents then prepared for their final presentation, given on
the 6th class session (Presentation Day). On Presentation 
Day, the entire class and 
instructor 
listened to each 
presentation sequentially. Students had only heard the 
presentations given by their small group on Practice Day, 
so this day was exciting to students because they want to 
learn about what other papers their peers had been read-
ing. Each presenter began with a blank cocktail napkin 
(12.5 cm x 12.5 cm) and drew ""on the spot""
. The drawing 
was projected to a screen via a document camera to pro-
vide the class with maximum visibility. 
Following the 
presentation, the instructor or students asked questions to 
the presenter, though this time was used as a low-stakes 
opportunity for further learning and discussion, and was not 
part of any formal assessment of the activity. Anonymous 
peer feedback was given after each presentation while the 
instructor completed his own evaluation of the presenta-
tion, using the criteria listed above. Each student present-

students understand how an invasive species may change 
the ecological and socio-economic balance of an ecosys-
tem, and (3) have students consider and evaluate different

ment at the ecosystem level. We focus on the complexity of

how they justify their groupâÃÃ´s choice of action.",,"Case studies are defined as problem-based stories that 
have an underlying educational goal. Cases allow instruc-
tors to bring real-life problems into the classroom when 
time, financial, or staff resource limitations may prevent 
taking students out of the classroom into field settings 
where similar objectives of active engagement can also be 
achieved. Case studies are effective in stimulating active 
learning in a large classroom as they require students to 
use prior knowledge (gained either inside or outside of the 
classroom), think constructively, solve problems, and make 
decisions toward solving the new problem presented to 
them in the case (Wilson, 1987; Herreid, 2005).
While active learning is supported by the literature, 
the initial transition from passive to active classrooms can 
pose challenges for both the instructors and students, 
especially in large classes. Small group exercises, such 
as those employed in the case study presented in this 
article, are an effective strategy for engaging students in 
a large class (i.e., >100 students). There is much debate 
about the appropriate size of in-class groups. Many stud-
ies suggest that three to four students per group is ideal as 
each individual stays engaged by answering, recording, or 
debating the answer to the problem posed (Sutko, 2000); 
however, the optimal group size is likely dependent on the 
task at hand. Discussion among students in small groups in 
the classroom offers a multitude of benefits, one of which is 
practice communicating academic concepts to their peers. 
Verbal skills are often left aside in large lecture classes. In 
case studies involving small group work such as the one 
presented here, students move through several cycles of 
being listener, speaker, recorder, and debater and thus 
advance verbal communication skills while also learning 
objective-driven content.



Specifically, the case 
aims to (1) stimulate critical thinking and discussion within 
groups, (2) familiarize students with a popular invasive 
species problem, (3) teach the students ecological and 
socio-economic consequences of invasive species and their

Feedback from the Authors and Students
This case study was presented to the Principles of Fish-
eries and Wildlife Sciences class of 153 students during 
the fall semester of 2007 at Virginia Tech (VT, FiW 2114, 
see http://www.undergradcatalog.registrar.vt.edu/0708/
nr/fiw.html [verified 10 Mar. 2009] for course description). 
About 50% of the students in this class were second-
year majors in the VT College of Natural Resources and 
the other 50% were a mixture of majors from across the 
campus that took the course to fulfill the Critical Issues 
in a Global Context requirement of the VT Curriculum for 
Liberal Education. The students taking this course as part 
of the Curriculum for Liberal Education range from first- 
to fourth-year classification. The activities of the case 
(Part IâÃÃ¬III) were preceded by a 30-minute lecture about 
invasive species and ecosystem management with infor-
mation drawn from the materials provided in the Introduc-
tion provided earlier in this article. Brief required readings 
were also distributed to the students before the case was 
presented. These readings provide more detail about 
defining a problem statement, determining beneficial uses, 
and creating management goals (see Gibbons et al., 1994 
for the material).
At the end of the semester, approximately 2 weeks 
after this case was delivered, the students were asked to 
evaluate this case study and provide feedback. They were 
specifically asked to (1) provide free form feedback on 
any of the eight case studies which they were presented 
throughout the semester, and (2) rank each case study 
from 1 to 10, with a rank of 1 described as ""Do not use 
this case study again; I did not enjoy it and I learned little 
from it,"" and a rank of 10 described as ""Most definitely 
use this case study again; I enjoyed it and I learned from 
it."" Out of the class of 153 students, 110 responded to the 
end-of-class survey. Of those respondents, the average 
ranking of this invasive species management case study 
was 7.5, with a range from 2 to 10. This indicates that 
this case study was well-received by the students. We did 
not receive any free-form written comments about this 
particular case study, but students did favorably review 
the case study style of teaching in this course overall with 
comments such as the following: ""I really enjoyed the 
variety of subjects and teaching methods in this class,"" 
and ""Case studies were nice because they showed the 
real-world applications of the material.""
In fall of 2008, we presented the case study in an 
abbreviated form to the VT Conservation Biology class of 
47 students (FiW 4314). The students were presented with 
an introductory lecture on invasive species ecology in the 
first 50-minute class and worked through the case study 
in groups during the second class period. Responses to the 
questions from the students in the upper-level class were 
more concise and solution-oriented than those provided 
by the introductory class. The difference in responses 
between the introductory and upper-level classes may 
reflect the knowledge and experiences acquired during 
the second and third years in the Fisheries and Wildlife 
Sciences curriculum at Virginia Tech. Students in the 
Conservation Biology class were more aware and respon-
sive to the ecological implications of the invasive species 
introduction and management. They also demonstrated a 
stronger understanding of stakeholder values and the role 
of stakeholders in management decisions. When asked 
to reflect on the case study experience, students in the 
upper-level Conservation Biology class responded that 
more time would have been helpful to tease out all of the 
case complexities. They added that more time to conduct 
independent research on the problem and to develop an 
experimental field design would have been helpful and 
interesting. Overall, the students said they enjoyed the 
interaction of the groups, the hands-on activities, and the 
interrupted nature of the teaching case.
We were pleased at the overall results and responses of 
the students after completing this case in two very differ-
ent classes. In the weeks that followed the presentation of 
this case in both years, the students improved their ability 
to define natural resource problems and demonstrated a 
stronger focus on root causes. Students also became more 
aware of the various consequences of management action 
on an ecosystem level. Our positive experiences lead us to 
encourage other professors in natural resources and ecol-
ogy departments to incorporate this or a similar case study 
into their course curriculum.

",,"The Lesson was developed for a class of 30 students working in groups of three to five. The 
students organize themselves into groups; however, the membership of individual groups 
does change from time to time. Although students work in groups, each student submits 
their own individual work for grading (see Supporting File S3: Cell Signaling Activity and 
Supporting File S4: Functional Genomics Activity). The steps in both documents require 
active participation in reading passages, retrieving information and data, and analyzing and 
presenting data.

The steps for engaging students in active learning activities are presented in Figure 1 and 
Table 2.

The instructor introduces the content and tools to enable students to effectively read the 
literature and analyze data in the initial steps of the Lesson. However, it may be necessary to 
reiterate some concepts as students discover new information to reinforce the learning and 
enhance self-efficacy. The second step is accomplished through reading and interacting with 
pathways data on the RGD website (). At this stage, students identify each of the steps on 
the signal transduction pathway by clicking on specific proteins to retrieve curated
functional information. For example, clicking on a receptor may yield further information on 
classification and both natural and pharmacological ligands. This could lead to a discussion 
on the different functional outcomes of ligand-receptor interaction and the concepts of 
agonism and antagonism, including medical applications. A similar activity on a signaling 
molecule could yield information on biochemical activity, such as kinase or adenylyl cyclase 
activity. This then leads to a discussion on signal transduction and amplification. The 
instructor visits the groups during groupwork to encourage discussion and to offer assistance 
as necessary. The small-group discussions are interrupted periodically to allow for report out 
sessions in which different groups take leadership in explaining a biological concept to the 
class. The open-ended nature of this Lesson allows the instructor to tailor the depth and 
breadth of coverage to the existing background knowledge of his or her students and the 
desired level of difficulty. This module then serves to develop the Background section of a 
report and it creates many opportunities for students to discuss the concepts within groups 
and to report the groupsâÃÃ´ synthesis to the class. Given that each student will be graded on 
submitted work, students are usually very motivated to cooperate in finding as much 
information as possible. Group presentations are awarded participation points. At the 
conclusion of this section, and consistent with contemporary approaches to research, the 
students develop a hypothesis on the outcomes of inhibition of a pathway on a biological 
process. The end points are chosen based on feasibility of implementation.

In the second module of the Lesson (see Supporting File S4: Functional Genomics Activity), 
microarray data from NCBIâÃÃ´s GEO DataSets () is analyzed following two approaches. In 
the first approach, students use data analysis tools provided by GEO. This includes 
hypothesis testing with t test and clustering. At this point, the different levels of stringency 
afforded by p-values are demonstrated and discussed. Experimental design is also examined 
with the students being asked to choose different samples to serve as either case or control. 
In the second approach, the students download the datasets for analysis with geWorkbench 
(). In both modules, the students enter their responses in the spaces provided in 
Supporting File S4.

Through these activities, the students work in groups to develop the key points for the lab 
report while receiving feedback at different steps (Figure 1). The report then includes results 
of data analysis using software as well as figures summarizing the data (see Figures 2 and 
3).",,Formative assessment; Paper / report / problem set; Worksheet; Other,class discussions,"The Lesson is designed to use publicly available molecular biology resources to teach both 
the process of science and a key topic in cell biology. At the beginning of the modules, 
students answer specific questions related to NCBI resources to gauge their prior knowledge

and software packages on the Web including the resources provided by the NCBI, RGD,

). Our assessment helps to collect information on the 
baseline knowledge of molecular biology techniques and complementary bioinformatics 
tools, structure instructor led demonstrations, and to provide students with an overview of 
the learning objectives of the Lesson. In the initial phases, writing coherent passages from 
scientific literature are developed. When students review the RGD pathways, they report on 
the functions of the proteins involved by reading from other resources (see Supporting File 
S3: Cell Signaling Activity, question 1). The instructions for students list the elements of an 
Introduction section of a scientific paper. An explanation of how to coach students on 
scientific writing is given under Notes for instructors (see Supporting File S3: Cell Signaling 
Activity, at the end of the introduction section) and the instructor can use other resources, for 
example the Elsevier guide (
âÃÂ¶). Short answer questions are interspersed within the procedures (see 
Supporting File S3: Cell Signaling Activity and Supporting File S4: Functional Genomics 
Activity). These questions seek to integrate the analytical stages of the Lesson with the 
biological facts or knowledge and to develop a habit of thinking in an integrated manner. For 
example, after reviewing the PI3K-AKT pathway on RGD the students answer questions on 
the functions of AKT domains (see Supporting File S3: Cell Signaling Activity, question 4). 
One of the follow up questions allows students to discuss the mechanisms of activation of 
AGC kinases to which AKT belongs (see Supporting File S3: Cell Signaling Activity, 
question 5). Implicit in this question is the evolutionary relatedness of these kinases, 
providing an opportunity to discuss the concept of evolution from a molecular perspective. 
The second module is devoted to data analysis and the questions relate to hypothesis testing 
(Supporting File S4: Functional Genomics Activity). For example, students formulate a 
hypothesis prior to data analysis, select groups of samples to compare, and select a statistical 
test to use and at each step they provide appropriate justifications by responding to questions 
(see questions 2, 5, 6, and 7). Each question in the protocols is graded by the instructor and 
20% of the grade for each Module comes from participation through class discussions. In 
addition to written answers, students generate figures and interpret gene expression data. At 
the end of the modules, they submit a final report that aggregates the different stages of the 
Lesson with corrections as suggested by the instructor",,Yes,"Cited as supplemental materials, supporting materials, or in an appendix",,Neutral,

SciComm can inform decision making and public policies. Recently, seminal reports have indicated that SciComm is a practice in which students should engage. Unfortunately, students have few opportunities to engage in SciComm, partially due to the absence of a framework that can help instructors facilitate such activities. We present a framework of the essential elements of effective SciComm that synthesizes previous work to describe the who, why, what, and how of effectively communicating science with nonexperts. We applied the framework to a lesson for undergraduate biology students and assessed student outcomes. The lesson uses an introduction, assignment sheet, and worksheet to guide students through planning, producing, and describing their SciComm assignment. We assessed the outcomes of the lesson by quizzing students on their knowledge of SciComm and asking about their perceptions of SciComm and the lesson. Students performed well but focused some of their responses on what they were assigned in the lesson instead of what was best for effective SciComm. Moreover, students perceived the lesson positively. This work can be used by practitioners and researchers to understand how to engage students in the important scientific practice of SciComm.

1. Describe introductory neuroscience concepts in
relation to the research project.
2. Describe the molecular mechanisms of addiction.
3. Describe the molecular mechanisms of pain.
The application-based objectives were:
4. Critique, troubleshoot, and engage in a virtual team of
researchers to collaboratively complete a research
project.
5. Collect data with Drosophila melanogaster behavioral
techniques.
The synthesis-based objectives were:
6. Navigate the scientific literature to develop a
research project virtually.
7. Engage with recent scientific discoveries related to
the research project.

Students then work in their groups to collect data from skulls at the front of the classroom for the second problem.

role that colonialism played in museum collections, as well as 
the concept of decolonizing science. The homework questions, 
as well as class discussions, were designed to allow students 
with varying amounts of exposure to these concepts to share 
and reflect. Students who felt comfortable gave their permission 
to have their homework responses shared anonymously, which 
allowed students to read and respond to their peersâÃÃ´ perspectives.

perform in the subsequent class, while leaving the specific 
nature of those dissections up to their imaginations [for a 
similar approach, see (Masters and Christensen, 2000)].

snack cakes. The students then received the dissection 
âÃÃ²manualsâÃÃ´ (see Appendix A for manual and the complete 
assignment). The studentsâÃÃ´ goal was to work in groups to
delineate the 3D distribution of the cream filling of the 
snack cake using a combination of coronal, axial, and

slice using appropriate anatomical terminology. Following 
this, they wrote a one paragraph summary of their âÃÃ²findingsâÃÃ´

then 
compared/contrasted their work with a group who had

âÃÂ¢ 
Students will understand the basic structure of an HMM, the 
types of data used in ab initio gene prediction, and its consequent 
limitations.
âÃÂ¢ 
Students will understand the process of gene exon-intron boundary 
prediction, having altered the values for the key parameters and 
noted the impact on the prediction.
âÃÂ¢ 
Students will consider how the exon-intron boundary model might 
be designed to be more accurate, thinking about the biological 
features of the process and how they might be represented in a 
computer program. 
Learning Objective(s)
Students will be able to:
âÃÂ¢ 
Students will be able to process unannotated genomic data using 
ab initio gene finders as well as other inputs.
âÃÂ¢ 
Students will be able to defend the proposed gene annotation.
âÃÂ¢ 
Students will reflect on the other uses for HMMs",,"During the class, students engaged in manipulating the 
model and discussing the outcomes. Active learning strategies 
included collaborative problem-solving and subsequent 
discussion, as well as open-ended questions about potential 
complications in using HMMs.
",,Formative assessment; Exam; Paper / report / problem set; Summative Assessment,,"Formative assessment included monitoring each groupâÃÃ´s 
progress during class and steering student discussions as 
needed, then facilitating a class-wide discussion. At Truman, 
summative assessment was a question on the take-home final 
that students were required to work individually. The question 
asked students to apply HMM methods to a novel system (i.e. 
inferring the location of an alpha helix within a given amino 
acid sequence). Approximately 60% of students were able to 
estimate relevant parameter values and correctly calculate 
both the probability and the likelihood of a specific state path, 
while 70% were able to articulate the difference between 
these two measures. At Washington University, the studentsâÃÃ´ 
understanding of the HMM was assessed by reviewing the 
results of the homework (S7). The results are shown in Figure 
1. Overall, students were able to solve the problem correctly 
in 90% of the cases. Question 1a, which only 53% of the 
students answered correctly, required the students to draw a 
state diagram for an HMM that scans an un-annotated genome 
for genes with a start codon, a stop codon, exons, introns, a 
5âÃÃ´ splice site and a 3âÃÃ´ splice site. Collectively, the results from 
both universities suggest that the students had more difficulties 
in extrapolating the model (i.e. extending it to a new situation) 
than they had in using the model.
We believe that any assessment should include a 
component that measures studentsâÃÃ´ ability to apply the 
methods they have learned to a substantially different system. 
However, this expectation would be more meaningful as part 
of a larger, integrated research-like project than as a stand-
alone exam problem. We also think that assessment should 
explore studentsâÃÃ´ understanding of why and how HMMs work, 
focusing on specific aspects that were not directly addressed in 
the exercise (e.g., how to optimize the transition and emission 
probabilities of each state).",,Yes,"Cited as supplemental materials, supporting materials, or in an appendix",,Neutral,

Pre-Class 1: Two days prior to Class 1, students 
were instructed to read a detailed manual as well as 
view a recorded lecture on CTNNB1 syndrome, 
behavioral characteristics of the Åâ¤-catenin cKO 
Wickham et al. 
The Spine Lab: a short-duration, fully remote CURE 
A33 
mouse, and an overview of Åâ¤-catenin functions. 
Specifically, the lecture and laboratory manual 
provided an overview of CTNNB1 syndrome, 
introduced the Åâ¤-catenin cKO mouse as a model of 
human CTNNB1 loss of function, and explained the 
two major functions of Åâ¤-catenin that might be 
malfunctioning in the individuals with disruptive 
CTNNB1 gene mutations: cadherin-based synaptic 
adhesion and Wnt-target gene expression. Students 
at this stage had learned about long-term 
potentiation, an electrophysiological correlate of 
learning, 
and that 
synapses 
could 
enlarge 
(strengthen) or shrink (weaken) through experience 
and learning. 
Additionally, the lecture walked 
students through the general approach our class 
would use to assess changes in synaptic density 
and structural morphology. 
There was content 
overlap between the manual and the video to help 
reinforce concepts. The purpose of these items was 
to prepare students for the content and skills they 
would need to classify, count, and analyze spines 
and to help use this data from the cKOs to suggest 
potential 
mechanisms 
underlying 
CTNNB1 
Syndrome. 
ÃÃâ 
Class 1: In class, students conducted the pre- 
content test, STEM identity assessment, and CURE 
survey pre-questionnaire. 
Students individually 
formed hypotheses about how changes in spine 
density and/or morphology could lead to learning 
impairments in the Åâ¤-cat cKO mouse. 
ÃÃâ 
Class 2: Students were provided a pair of images 
(labeled A and B) and were instructed to classify and 
count the number of spines. Spine density was 
calculated by counting the number of spines on each 
dendrite for each image and by dividing by the 
length of the dendritic segment (provided to 
student). 
The spine fraction was calculated by 
counting the number of each spine subtype (thin, 
mushroom, stubby, or branched shape), and dividing 
each subtype by the total number of spines. 
Students then calculated spine density and fraction 
of mature spines. At the beginning of class up until 
30 minutes into class, students were allowed to 
anonymously submit annotated images via Canvas 
using a PowerPoint file to seek feedback. Typically, 
students would place a ""?"" over the spine. The 
instructor collected these images and made a 
separate PowerPoint deck. In the last 15 minutes of 
class, the instructor then went over each spine to 
provide both real-time iterative feedback to inquiring 
student but also extra practice for other students. 
ÃÃâ 
Class 3: Students met with their pre-assigned 
partners (who had the same set of images) to 
compare and contrast their analysis. Students re-
analyzed their data together, spine by spine 
compared classification and came to consensus. 
Once completed, students submitted their data using 
a shared Google Sheets document. 
ÃÃâ 
Between Class 3 and 4: 
The instructor (RJW) 
averaged spine density and spine fraction (the 
proportion of mushroom, thin, stubby, across 
images), 
performed 
statistical 
analyses, 
and 
provided students a graph of their results. Analysis 
was conducted separately for the two sections of the 
course. 
Each section had identical image sets, 
allowing for comparison across sections of the 
course. 
ÃÃâ 
Class 4: Students were provided a guided handout 
that allowed for discussion in small groups (groups 
of four, two pairs of partners) and full class 
discussion afterwards. 
ÃÃâ 
Between Class 4 and 5: Students created a poster 
and poster presentation (5-7 minutes) via Zoom and 
uploaded it to Canvas.

which the Spine Lab outperformed, underperformed, and 
similarly performed relative to traditional CUREs (Tables 2

This lesson plan was designed with learning objectives taken from
both the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) and Project
2061. The NGSS is comprised of learning domains consisting of
crosscutting concepts, science practices, and core ideas. These three
domains work in conjunction to help the student develop a deeper
understanding of science generally as well as how the various fields
of science are related to each other. This lesson plan was designed
with the crosscutting concepts of ""Science as a Human Endeavor""
and ""Science Addresses Questions about the Natural and Material
World,"" and the science practice concept of ""Scientific Knowledge
is based on Empirical Evidence."" All three of these NGSS concepts
are designed to help students develop a deeper understanding of
NOS. Therefore, this lesson was designed to explicitly address these
concepts through in-class discussion facilitated by the handouts,
the handshaking activity, and the court case reenactment. These
activities give the students hands-on experience with important
NOS ideas found in the Next Generation Science Standards (see
Table 1 for more details).
Project 2061 provides benchmarks for scientific literacy within
the classroom. These benchmarks are statements that act as goals of
learning within the classroom, which are based on student grade
level. The specific Project 2061 benchmark covered by this lesson
is The Scientific Enterprise: ""Scientists can bring information,
insights, and analytical skills to bear on matters of public concern.
Acting in their areas of expertise, scientists can help people under-
stand the likely causes of events and estimate their possible effects.
1C/H6ab."" This benchmark objective will be accomplished through
students working on Handouts 1âÃÃ¬3 (see Appendix) as well as
through in-class discussions and the court case reenactment. In this
way, students learn about MaryâÃÃ´s story, think about and discuss
how she was treated, and make a decision on how they felt her case
should be have handled through the court case reenactmentâÃÃ®all
before learning what was decided as the final verdict. These bench-
marks are not new curriculum, but rather act as a tool to aid in cur-
riculum reform, and because of this, these benchmarks dovetail
nicely with the Next Generation Science Standards. The following
lesson plan was designed with both Project 2061 and NGSS core
disciplinary ideas and NOS crosscutting concepts (see Table 1) in
mind in order to help students gain a deeper understanding of
NOS through an interactive and hands-on learning experience",Talks a lot about objectives and alignment to NGSS but I don't see them.

Second, standard content in undergraduate classes and textbooks still emphasizes the modal model of the senses and their corresponding brain areas and rarely mentions crossmodal phenomena. Third, feasible classroom demonstrations of cross-modality are few, making it difficult to provide students with first-hand experience that would aid their understanding of the principle. This article describes an accessible and effective classroom demonstration of cross-modality between lowlevel vision, touch and proprioception. It consists in the illusion of eyelid droop in one eye when the other eye has been dark-adapted and when both eyes are exposed to the dark. The perceptual effect is dramatic and reliable. It illustrates cross-modality at a fundamental level of perception and might provide a means to help integrate the teaching of the concept into the standard content of undergraduate classes.",9805,,University of St. Thomas,,University of St. Thomas,"""Students (n=91) in four psychology and neuroscience

related to community building. Students are asked to work 
collaboratively in small groups and to discuss poll questions. 
Poll questions are graded based on participation rather than 
selection of the correct answer. This grading policy encourages 
students to seek help when they are incorrect, rather than 
be concerned about their grade (12). Throughout the lesson, 
students are encouraged to share their opinions and unique 
perspectives on how to combat various societal challenges, 
including conservation and climate change, while respecting 
peers who may hold perspectives and opinions different from 
their own. When we taught this lesson, students disagreed 
regarding whether current biodiversity losses amount to a mass 
extinction event. Students also held differing views about the 
role of government in conservation. Despite these differences, 
discussion remained respectful, and students were receptive 
to alternative viewpoints. We encourage instructors to remind 
students to be respectful throughout the semester and to consider 
creating community guidelines for appropriate discussion 
behaviors.
Student socioeconomic diversity was also considered 
throughout the design of this lesson. To prevent economic 
barriers, students are not required to purchase any textbooks 
or other supplementary materials to participate in this lesson. 
Additionally, all assessment questions can be answered based 
on information provided on lecture slides and do not require 
outside resources. We also expose students to the work of 
under-acknowledged scientists. For example, we present 
the efforts of Marjorie Courtenay-Latimer, who was one of 
few woman museum curators in the early 1900s, toward 
preserving a coelacanth specimen (Supporting File S4. 6th 
Mass ExtinctionâÃÃ¬Class Session I Slides, Slide 16) with the goal 
of highlighting scientific contributions made by individuals of 
varied backgrounds (13).
Finally, students are provided with multiple means to achieve 
the desired learning objectives including discussion, writing, 
images and diagrams, and poll questions. Similarly, students 
are offered multiple formats of assessment questions including 
written and multiple choice to provide an opportunity for each 
student to display their knowledge of key concepts",,,No,,Yes,,"Learning Goals

(4 or 5 students) were held in breakout rooms. If students had 
a question, they could signal to a course instructor that they 
needed help and the instructor could visit their breakout room. 
If students could not attend the synchronous portion of the 
online class, they could watch the video of the class period 
and provide answers and explanations to each poll question. 
This asynchronous assignment needed to be completed within 
48 hours of when the class ended. 
Outside of class, students are asked to research an endangered 
species and submit a reflection about the potential cause of 
extinction for that species. They are also asked to participate in 
a discussion board and respond to peers about possible human 
interventions to prevent the extinction of an endangered species.",,Formative assessment; Quiz; Worksheet,,"During class, students are assessed in a variety of ways. 
Students are asked to respond to poll questions both individually

High-intensity active learning practices (defined as spending 
more than two-thirds of class time on active learning) have 
been shown to produce more equitable outcomes among 
diverse populations of students (27). This module exemplifies 
a high-intensity design developed specifically for a large-
lecture environment. Students are provided materials and a 
pre-class quiz to prepare for the in-class module, during which 
they spend the majority of their time working collaboratively 
to interpret data and craft written responses about what the 
data mean. Students also individually answer clicker questions 
and engage in whole-class and small-group discussion to 
draw connections between the clicker questions and their 
data interpretation. After the argumentation module, students 
engage in an individual writing activity to consolidate ideas 
from group and class discussion. Our decision to include 
individual writing activities for the argumentation modules 
was rooted in writing-to-learn research (28); most notably, 
research into the scientific writing heuristic approach to 
encourage individual knowledge consolidation outside of the

We used several formative assessments to diagnose student

both as a group and independently. Outside of class, students 
completed short activities designed to help them prepare 
for each in-class session and to support their learning by 
articulating their explanation for the observed phenotypic 
differences. The instructor could also use responses from 
these activities to address potential misunderstandings or 
to help frame whole-class discussion. Ultimately, student

A major challenge in cellular neuroscience is having biology students understand the equivalent circuit model of a neuron. Specifically, this activity is designed to reinforce the idea that neurons can generally be modeled as parallel resistor-capacitor circuits. This physical manifestation, known as the equivalent circuit model of a neuron, is the basis for nearly all aspects of a neurons ability to generate electrical signals. Furthermore, the equivalent circuit model allows for a quantitative and qualitative explanation for how biological neurons respond to inputs. This exercise also serves as a student's first introduction to Matlab, and as such, the exercise is designed to have students become familiar with interacting with Matlab via the script editor.
This exercise has two specific learning outcomes:
1. students will learn how resistance and capacitance shape a neuron's response to injected currents
2. explore the similarities between their model and their physical equivalent circuit representations

In addition to these outcomes, students perform dimensional analysis to check that units for different components are appropriate (e.g., Why are the units of the time constant for a neuron in seconds?). Students are also allowed to answer the questions posed throughout the lab to develop their critical thinking and communication skills.)""",,Would need to look at handouts to determine the teaching approaches,,Worksheet; Data (hand in a dataset and/or figure); Other,"Oral assessment, dimensional analysis","""Assessment
Students collect data just as they would if they were doing an experiment, and record their answers in their handouts. As they progress, students must answer questions about the data they are collecting; students write their answers in the handout. I can then assess their thinking and understanding. For example, I have the students orally describe how changing the parameters of the cell changes the response both quantitatively (in terms of changes in voltage) and qualitatively (time to reach steady state.) This way, I can assess their ability to discern the differences in responses when resistances are changed rather than capacitance (e.g., ""How are they the same? How are they different?) I also have them perform dimensional analysis so they can verify that the units of the parameters they calculate make sense. Taken as a whole, the exercise serves as a launching point for students to explore the same concept in biological neurons.""",,Yes,"Cited as supplemental materials, supporting materials, or in an appendix",,Easy,

Based on student's drawings, 96% of intermediate-level biology majors have unclear or incorrect ideas about meiosis. Students have difficulty diagramming the process of meiosis starting with three unreplicated pairs of chromosomes, and even when they can produce an accurate diagram, they are unclear how to assign the terms ""haploid"" and ""diploid."" We designed an interactive lesson based on constructivist theory to address these issues in a large lecture class. Pretest and posttest scores showed a significant improvement in students' understanding of ploidy compared to a parallel class taught in the traditional way (e.g. using the textbook diagrams).

This lab exercise should develop and improve lab skills, 
result in collection and quantitative analysis of data, and 
introduce or solidify concepts surrounding cell and circuit 
properties responsible for rhythmic neural activity.
Skills
Students should gain or improve dissection and recording 
skills. The dissection is only slightly more difficult than 
simple crayfish dissections and the difficulty of recording is 
on a par with other nerve recordings (e.g., crayfish 
superficial flexor nerve; Wyttenbach et al., 2014). If students 
have experience with dissection and nerve recording, this 
exercise can be done in a three-hour period. We do it after 
students have recorded from crayfish nerves and performed 
spike analysis. Students new to dissection and recording
may need two lab periods to develop skills and collect data.

Data
Every lab group should be able to record rhythmic activity in 
several nerves and measure responses to feeding 
stimulants and neuromodulators. Data can be shared so 
that the entire class analyzes a variety of data. Depending 
on course goals, students can describe these results and 
changes qualitatively or perform sophisticated measures of 
cyclic spiking activity in multiple axons per nerve. One 
strength of this system is the ability to make similar 
measurements of behavior and neural activity.
Concepts
Students will see, first-hand, the action of a CPG and its 
modulation by sensory stimuli and neuromodulators.

that lead to intrinsic bursting, circuit properties such as 
reciprocal inhibition that affect oscillation and phasing, and 
mechanisms by which dopamine and serotonin can

paper format and are graded on writing, data analysis and 
presentation, and scientific content of their Introduction and 
Discussion sections. Questions 1-2 are prompts for Results 
material, while questions 3-8 would be addressed in the 
Discussion section. In a class where lab reports are instead 
done as worksheets, an instructor could write more specific 
prompts based on these questions.
 After several years doing nerve recording as part of a 
block of intracellular-recording labs, we started using it as a 
formal exercise in 2018. Dissection and recording videos 
were produced in Fall 2019. Qualitatively, this lab exercise 
appears to be a success: students get data, enjoy seeing 
rhythmic activity, and are excited to see changes due to 
feeding stimuli and neuromodulation. They often ask about 
circuit- and molecular-level explanations for these effects. 
 
Concerning our skill, data, and concept objectives, 
analysis of lab reports at Emory (Spring semesters 2018, 
2019, and 2020) is encouraging. These semesters had a

11 groups successfully recorded from 2-4 nerves and did 1-
3 manipulations (usually lettuce juice or serotonin, 
sometimes dopamine or glutamate). This indicates that the 
skill objective was met. Each lab group co-authored a report 
that combined nerve recording data with subsequent 
intracellular recording data. Based on the Results sections 
of their reports, the data objective was met: 11/11 showed 
examples of nerve recording, with 7/11 measuring cyclic 
parameters; 10/11 showed examples of changes due to 
manipulation, with 7/11 quantifying changes in cyclic 
parameters. In the Introduction or Discussion sections of 
their reports, 10/11 covered CPGs and model systems, 8/11 
discussed mechanisms that might modulate nerve activity, 
and 8/11 attempted to determine which identified neurons 
were responsible for the nerve activity they saw, based on

Squirrel-Net modules in general are designed to provide all 
students in a class with the opportunity to engage in authentic 
research experiences. Participating in CUREs, like Squirrel-
Net, has been shown to have significant impacts on studentsâÃÃ´ 
sense of self-efficacy as a scientist and may promote retention 
in science, particularly for students from under-represented 
groups (20). One unique element of this CURE is the use of the 
national network, which we believe will further help students 
feel as though they are making important contributions and 
belong to a broader scientific community beyond their specific 
classroom or institution (21).
Depending on how the instructor implements this activity, 
there are numerous opportunities for active learning techniques 
such as multiple-hands, multiple-voices, think-pair-share, 
and whip arounds, each of which provide a less-intimidating 
opportunity for all students to contribute their voice to the 
discussion (22). We have also used jigsaw to dissect primary 
literature articles (e.g., 4-9) related to the activity. This can be 
done separately in a 50-minute lecture period or a shorter

introductory laboratory courses (e.g., pipetting, culturing
bacteria, and record keeping). However, activities can be
easily amended for an introductory class such that basic
laboratory skills can be introduced at the time of or prior to

The overall learning objectives for the CURE are for students
to be able to:
(1) Describe the impact of microbes on our living planet and
their host environments.
(2) Sample and compare microbial
 communities
(microbiomes).
(3) Formulate testable hypotheses to address a research
question and design an experiment to test the hypotheses.

bioinformatic techniques used to study microbiome data.
(5) Analyze 16S rRNA gene sequence data with common
techniques used in microbiome research.
(6) Interpret figures generated from microbiome
sequence data.
(7) Communicate findings to peers via oral or poster
presentations and scientific writing (report).

objective may be for students to ""Discuss and pose a meaningful
research question that builds on prior research."" Learning
objectives can be modified and amended by the faculty based
on the specific research questions asked. Published example

to provide students with visual materials they can reference 
at their own pace. Most of the assignments are low stakes to 
help minimize student stress and to facilitate student learning. 
By using free, web-based bioinformatics tools that have a GUI 
format, we aim to increase the accessibility and comfort level 
of students towards conceptual understanding of the material. 
Students are also allowed ample time outside of class to 
complete assignments. Students may perform the analyses 
alone if they choose, or in groups of 2-4 students to encourage 
discussion and peer mentoring. Additionally, as this entire 
lesson plan may be performed online, these activities facilitate 
remote learning.
The web-based tools presented here are well suited for 
remote inclusive teaching because they do not require high-
end or expensive computer systems, nor do they require high-
speed internet. Although microbiome datasets can be quite 
large, students do not need to upload or download any large 
datasets or files, as all file transfers are done virtually via the 
CyVerse infrastructure connected to DNA Subway. Similarly, 
all computational processes performed by DNA Subway are 
run virtually via the CyVerse infrastructure, decreasing the 
dependence on reliable internet connectivity (once a job is 
started it runs regardless of whether one is connected to the 
internet or logged onto DNA Subway). It also eliminates the 
need for large memory or processing requirements of personal 
computers. In fact, the analysis performed by DNA Subway
can be successfully completed using a smartphone with a web 
browser, which would allow students without a computer or 
internet access to complete this activity.
We also acknowledge the barriers that remain for many 
students and institutions relating to lack of adequate technology 
or internet connectivity, and that each college or university 
tackles such challenges differently. We also acknowledge that 
there is no single answer that will accommodate all students 
and institutions. For educators who may be interested in 
incorporating this activity with their students, but who are 
concerned about the lack of access to technology for their 
students, one possible alternative may be for the instructor 
to perform the DNA Subway and ranacapa analyses that 
their students recommend (based on initial discussion and 
hypothesis generation step) and print the resulting graphs and 
figures of each step performed along the way to show students 
the process. These hardcopies may then be disseminated to 
students, where they can follow the written tutorial and learn 
to interpret each of the graphs. In this way, students may still 
be engaged with the data analysis and graph interpretation 
process, even if they did not go through the steps on a 
computer themselves. In this case, the learning outcomes

results as opposed to the technical aspects of using the web

simulated via freely downloadable datasets from various sources (S1. Analysis of 
Microbiomes - Table of next-generation sequence datasets). The lesson presented 
here will work with a variety of datasets, allowing for flexibility in the curriculum. 
Students may still go through the steps of the scientific process, such as hypotheses 
formation, data analysis, and communications of findings.

video tutorials may be assigned and graded as complete or 
incomplete (See Timeline of DNA Subway and ranacapa
lessons). The written tutorials have been included here as 
Supporting Files S7-S10, and the links for the video tutorials 
can be found in the corresponding written tutorial. One of 
the tutorials (S10. Analysis of Microbiomes - Community 
analysis with ranacapa) contains conceptual questions 
that can be treated as a low-stakes assignment intended to 
encourage students to research the tool and explain their 
understanding in writing. Example answers for conceptual 
questions are included in S11. Analysis of Microbiomes - 
Rubric for Community analysis with ranacapa questions. 
There is also an optional quiz that instructors may assign to 
assess understanding of the major steps involved in sequence 
processing using DNA Subway (S15. Analysis of Microbiomes 
- Quiz on DNA Subway tutorial). At the completion of the 
module, instructors may assign a written/formal report, oral 
presentation, or both as graded assignments. Reports and 
presentations should include background and rationale for 
the samples being compared, results of community analysis, 
conclusions about implications of differences in diversity 
between samples, and future directions. Example rubrics for 
assessing studentsâÃÃ´ oral and written presentations are also 
available (see Supporting Files S12, S13).",,Yes,"Cited as supplemental materials, supporting materials, or in an appendix; Located on an external website",,Neutral,

This situation has, however, dramatically changed in 2020 in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, which forced colleges to rapidly transit from face-to-face instructions to online classes. Here, we report the development of an interactive simulator that is freely available on the web (http://neurosphere.cos.northeastern.edu/) for teaching lab classes in developmental biology. This simulator is based on cellular automata models of neural-stem-cell-driven tissue growth in the neurosphere assay. By modifying model parameters, users can explore the role in tissue growth of several developmental mechanisms, such as regulation of mitosis or apoptotic cell death by contact inhibition. Besides providing an instantaneous animation of the simulated development of neurospheres, the Neurosphere Simulator tool offers also the possibility to download data for detailed analysis. The simulator function is complemented by a tutorial that introduces students to computational modeling of developmental processes.
